# Installation and Usage

## Requirements

To install this library, you will need at least the python packages [nltk](http://www.nltk.org/), [numpy](http://www.numpy.org/), [scikit-learn](http://scikit-learn.org/), and [pandas](http://pandas.pydata.org/). We recommend using [Anaconda](https://www.continuum.io/downloads):

```bash
$ # create a new anaconda environment with required packages
$ conda create -n article-tagging nltk numpy scikit-learn pandas pytest
$ source activate article-tagging
(article-tagging) $ ...
```

## Installation

Download the code from git, `cd` into the directory, and run the setup.py file. If you created an Anaconda environment, then make sure that environment is active before running the setup file.

```bash
$ git clone git@github.com:chicago-justice-project/article-tagging.git
$ cd article-tagging
$ python setup.py install
```

### nltk

As long as the nltk package is already installed, running the setup.py file should automatically download the required nltk corpora. If that does not work for some reason, then you will need to download the corpora manually. See the list `required_nltk_packages` in setup.py. Each corpus can be downloaded by running `nltk.download(corpus_name)`

## Testing

You will additionally need `pytest` installed to run the tests.

## Usage

### Inside python

The main class is `tagnews.crimetype.tag.Tagger`:

```python
>>> import tagnews
>>> tagger = tagnews.crimetype.tag.Tagger()
>>> article_text = 'This is an article about lots of crimes. Crimes about drugs.'
>>> tagger.relevant(article_text, prob_thresh=0.1)
True
>>> tagger.tagtext(article_text, prob_thresh=0.5)
['DRUG', 'CPD']
>>> tagger.tagtext_prob(article_text)
<pandas series>
```

### Command line interface

The installation comes with a command line interface, which without any arguments defaults to reading from the stdin.

```bash
$ python -m tagnews.crimetype.cli
Go ahead and start typing. Hit ctrl-d when done.
<type here>
```

Or you can provide an article to tag.

```bash
$ python -m tagnews.crimetype.cli sample-article.txt
$ cat sample-article.txt.tagged
GUNV, 0.9877
HOMI, 0.8765
...
```

Note that the `-m` flag is required.

# Background

We want to compare the amount different types of crimes are reported in certain areas vs. the actual occurrence amount in those areas. Are some crimes under-represented in certain areas but over-represented in others? To accomplish this, we'll need to be able to extract a type-of-crime tag and geospatial data from news articles.

We meet every Tuesday at [Chi Hack Night](https://chihacknight.org/), and you can find out more about [this specific project here](https://github.com/chihacknight/breakout-groups/issues/61).

The [Chicago Justice Project](http://chicagojustice.org/) has been scraping RSS feeds of articles written by Chicago area news outlets for several years, allowing them to collect almost 300,000 articles. At the same time, an amazing group of [volunteers](http://chicagojustice.org/volunteer-for-cjp/) have helped them tag these articles. The tags include crime categories like "Gun Violence", "Drugs", "Sexual Assault", but also organizations such as "Cook County State's Attorney's Office", "Illinois State Police", "Chicago Police Department", and other miscellaneous categories such as "LGBTQ", "Immigration". The volunteer UI was also recently updated to allow highlighting of geographic information.

# Areas of research

## Type-of-Crime Article Tagging

This part of this project aims to automate the category tagging using a specific branch of Machine Learning known as Natural Language Processing.

Possible models to use (some of which we have tried!) include

* [Bag of words](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bag-of-words_model)
* [*n*-gram models](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/N-gram)
* [A combination of bag-of-words and *n*-gram models](http://www.inference.phy.cam.ac.uk/hmw26/papers/nescai2006.pdf)
* [Word Vectorization as a pre-processing step](https://www.tensorflow.org/tutorials/word2vec/)
* [Convolutional Neural Networks](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1504.01255v3.pdf)
* [Recurrent Neural Networks](http://www.cs.toronto.edu/~graves/preprint.pdf)

It might be useful to have an additional corpus of news articles that we can use for unsupervised feature learning without having to worry about over-fitting.

## Automated Geolocation

We also need to automatically find the geographic area of the crime the article is talking about. We have just recently updated the tagging interface to also allow highlighting geospatial information inside of articles and are collecting ground truth data. Once we have collected this data, we need to automate the process of detecting location information inside articles. An important note, we are relying on the power of current geocoders to take unstructured location information and output a latitude/longitude pair.

One possible path forward appeared to involve an approach developed by  [Everyblock](http://www.everyblock.com/). They got funding from the [Knight Foundation](http://www.knightfoundation.org/) to geolocate news articles and were required to open source their code. A brief investigation seems to show that their geolocating is actually just a giant [Regular Expression](https://github.com/kbrose/everyblock/blob/master/ebdata/ebdata/nlp/addresses.py). Investigation showed that it was not accurate enough on its own for our purposes.

## Things to consider

Some articles may discuss multiple crimes. Some crimes may occur in multiple areas, whereas others may not be associated with any geographic information (e.g. some kinds of fraud).

# The Code

Under the `lib` folder you can find the source code.

The `load_data.py` file will load the data from the CSV files (stored not in GitHub). Specifically, look at the `load_data.load_data()` method, this returns a `k`-hot encoded tagging and article data.

# How to Contribute FAQ

### How can I stay up to date on what you're doing with article-tagging?
Check this document for updates and subscribe to the #quantifyingjusticenews channel on Chi Hack Night's team on Slack.
### Where is this scraped data that you're using and how do I get it?
The scraped data is NOT housed in a Github repositiory - it's on a flash drive.  Come to Chi Hack Night in person and save it onto your computer!
### Do I have to use a specific language to participate in article-tagging?
Thusfar, most of the work has been done in Python, but there's no reason that always has to be the case. If there is another language that would be perfect for this project or that you have expertise in, that works too.
### Are there concepts that will be helpful for me to understand?
Definitely!  [This sklearn user guide](http://scikit-learn.org/stable/modules/feature_extraction.html#text-feature-extraction) details a number of the text analysis methodologies this project uses (sklearn is a Python library, but the user guide is great for understanding machine learning text analysis in general).  Also, see the section above on 'Automated Article Tagging' for more detailed literature on some of the relevant concepts.
### I want to contribute to Chicago Justice Project but I donâ€™t want to work on tagging article subjects OR geolocating articles. What can I do?
Help [the team scraping articles](https://github.com/chicago-justice-project/chicago-justice) (that's where this team gets its data) or help [the team building a front-end](https://github.com/chicago-justice-project/chicago-justice-client)to share this project's insights with Chicago and the world. Or just show up Tuesday nights and ask what you can do!

# Saving a new model

Working with pickle is difficult. In order to sanely be able load things, I'm running python files that pickle the model using the `-m` flag, e.g. `python -m tagnews.crimetype.models.binary_stemmed_logistic.model`.
