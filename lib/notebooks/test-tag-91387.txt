A 20-year-old man has been hospitalized after police in the Far South Side's
West Pullman neighborhood found him bleeding from a gunshot wound.

Shortly before midnight, police were called to the 12300 block of South Union
Avenue and found a man shot in the right side of the abdomen, Chicago Police
Department News Affairs Officer Hector Alfaro said.

Paramedics rushed the man to Advocate Christ Medical Center in Oak Lawn, where
he was listed in serious condition.

The man told police had been shot in the 6900 block of South Halsted Street,
in the Englewood neighborhood, but officers found no shell casings or crime
scene there, according to police.

Police said the man was not cooperating with authorities.

Area South detectives are investigating the shooting and have no one in
custody.
