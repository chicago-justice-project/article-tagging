**(CBS)**Â March means one thing for The Boers and Bernstein Show. It's time to f
ind our who or what is the worst of the worst.

Boers and Bernstein are holding their annual Tournament of Bad competition, in
which listeners and readers decide the absolute worst of all things bad. We
started with 68 entrants, and you'll decide the bottom of the barrel.

You can stay involved on Twitter using #TOB2014 and find [tournament
