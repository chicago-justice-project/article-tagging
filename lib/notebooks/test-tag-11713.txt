charged with official misconduct for allegedly accessing a police computer
system and sharing the information with a friend, officials said.

release from the DuPage County State's Attorney's Office.

Chammas is accused of accessing the state's Law Enforcement Agencies Data
System, or LEADS, in May 2011 and making "an inquiry for purposes other than
official law enforcement business," the release stated.

  
LEADS gathers information from all the state's law enforcement offices about
stolen property, warrants, missing persons and other police matters.

  
Chammas, a records specialist with the tollway, was charged with two counts of
official misconduct, a felony, according to the news release.

  
The release didn't say what kind of information Chammas allegedly acquired or
why she wanted it.

  
"This appears to be an isolated incident and no other employees of the Tollway
Authority were involved," said DuPage County State's Attorney Robert Berlin.

  
Chammas is an information processing operator responsible for entering
enforcement documents into the State Police Traffic and Information Planning
System, a tollway spokeswoman said.

  
Chammas is currently on unpaid leave from the tollway, the spokeswoman said.
