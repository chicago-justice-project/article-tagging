** Abena Joan Brown **  was an unapologetic culturist, an Afro-centric culturist
, that is. She was a one woman powerhouse, a dynamic force unto herself. She kne
w exactly what she wanted. She put the F in focus. She built a major institution
 for Black people to participate fully in the theater and the arts. She was a fu
ndraiser, a director, an actress but most of all a producer. She transformed. Sh
e changed lives. She was stern and firm. If she loved you, it was without reserv
ation and in her way she assumed responsibility for you, perhaps beyond what you
 knew or deserved. ETA was her creation. She was its developer from land, to sea
ts, to fundraise, to stage. She served as president for four decades, since 1971
. 

She was a builder. She built a theater from a few uncomfortable seats to a
plush 200-seat theater with an art gallery. The day the new theater opened was
memorable. Her dream realized. She made an entire community participate in her
vision. That evening she became the “Grand Yeye” long before the African
Festival of the Arts installed her officially in 1994. She told the stories of
Black life. Before ETA she was a Director of Program Services at the YWCA. Her
bio reads that she produced over 200 professional productions.

##  On Building ETA . . .

click here for WTTW interview with Abena Joan Brown

If she saw talent, she developed it. I worked with Abena and her loyal board
member and dear friend,  ** Nancy McKeever. **   _ ** _  I was her publicist.
We produced the season's brochure. My initial assignment was to have
mainstream newspaper critics review ETA plays. The major papers were not
paying attention to Black plays in Black theater houses. My task was to make
them take notice.

It took a year to breakthrough. The night the  _ Chicago Tribune _  critic was
scheduled to review there was a very bad storm preventing him from attending
opening night. Abena was disappointed and cussed me very badly. I quit,
because I had no control over the storm. She thought he used the storm as an
excuse, not to travel to the South Side. I had not thought of that. She told
me, you are being paid to get the review. I don’t give a damn about the storm.
I walked out of the theater, saying I would complete ETA's season schedule,
but I was done. I went home, to wait for a furniture delivery. The fearless
ETA ladies knocked on my door, to say they would wait with me. Abena said
there is no quitting, no resigning until the job was complete. Your task, she
said, is to get white press to view us. She apologized somewhat for using such
harsh words. But, you can’t leave because we are a team.

##  Her Afrocentric View . . .

![ct-abena-joan-brown-obit-20150713-1][10]

Abena and I became friends. She was a no nonsense person, and made everybody
live beyond themselves. Eventually the white critics came to review ETA plays.
They were surprised and most were in awe of Abena herself. She wanted to show
another dynamic on Black life. It’s important for us to tell our story, to
define ourselves, to claim what’s important, was her teaching.

When I started  _ N'DIGO, _  we talked a lot about the concept, the idea of a
newspaper of features. I worked off of her concept of telling our story,
featuring our people, showcasing our world, with no apology. Of course, she
was a cover story and received the NDIGO Award in 2000. She was proud she told
me that evening. I was prouder of her. She told me I would change, because now
you are on a mission. Do your job right, because you will represent people,
she told me. Use your voice as you become. Sometimes when I was wrestling with
an issue, a tough column about a hot topic, she advised me. Be serious about
what you do. No foolishness. That was her message to many. In essence, her
legacy is stand tall, don't compromise. She made us serious. She made us
serious about ourselves with much pride. She was an institution builder. She
knew how to build, how to grow and how to train. She talked often about the
training ground and about building businesses, and cultural institutions.

##  The Grand Dame of Black Theater. . .

Abena was a Who’s Who, having received top honors in her discipline at every
turn. She was a pioneer. She started much; she was the reason that much
started. She will long be remembered. She made Chicago a better place. She
improved Black life, with exposure.

She was a culturist who touched lives. I am proud to have been affected by her
very stern hand. She was unapologetic with an Afrocentric viewpoint.

** Her life will be celebrated with a Memorial Service. Thursday, July 23 at Rev
. Leon Finney's Metropolitan Apostolic Community Church, 41st and King Drive at 
7: 00 p.m. Viewing of the body is Tuesday, July 21 from noon to 8 pm. at Cage Me
morial, 7651 South Jeffery Boulevard. **
