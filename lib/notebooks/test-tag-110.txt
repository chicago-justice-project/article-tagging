If at first you don't succeed, try, try again. Just do it much faster next
time.

  
That appears to be the thinking of federal prosecutors at the retrial of
former Illinois [ Gov. Rod Blagojevich ][2] , who told the judge presiding
over the case that they expect to call their last witness as soon as today.

Since opening statements at the beginning of the month, it has been obvious
that prosecutors streamlined and refocused their presentation of evidence,
dropping extraneous details and concentrating mostly on the marquee charge
that Blagojevich tried to sell the [ U.S. Senate ][22] seat vacated by [
Barack Obama ][21] upon his election as president in 2008.

  
Now a wrapup on Thursday would put prosecutors weeks ahead of the pace of last
summer's trial when a jury deadlocked on all but one of the 24 counts.
Prosecutors have taken about half the time they spent to put on their case
last time.

  
The conclusion of the prosecution case also sets the stage for possible
landmark testimony by Blagojevich. In an interview just before the retrial's
start, the former governor said there was a "strong likelihood" he would take
the witness stand, though he has not promised to do so in open court. And last
time, of course, he pledged to testify, only to change his mind. Last time, in
fact, Blagojevich didn't put on any evidence, though his brother, Robert, a
co-defendant, testified.

  
Sources on Wednesday said Blagojevich is being prepared by his attorneys to
take the witness stand next week.

  
U.S. District Judge James Zagel has virtually forced the defense to call
witnesses, limiting cross-examinations from straying too far from the
prosecution view of the facts. Zagel has said that last summer he gave the
defense more leeway, believing prosecutors would have a chance to cross-
examine Blagojevich, but that failed to pan out.

  
The defense has tried to suggest there are other ways to interpret what
happened in the fall of 2008 when Blagojevich was secretly recorded by the
government, and it could now take Blagojevich himself to try to explain to the
jury what he supposedly was thinking.

  
The jurors at the first trial -- who convicted Blagojevich only of lying to
the [ FBI ][20] -- have said they were confused by a mountain of evidence. In
addition to the recordings, the government had detailed allegations that
Blagojevich led a sweeping conspiracy to enrich himself from his first days in
office through his arrest in December 2008.

  
Prosecutors responded to the first trial's disappointing conclusion by
dropping the broad conspiracy counts and dismissing charges against
Blagojevich's brother, who headed campaign fundraising. The government boiled
down its case to just five key crimes -- the Senate seat sale as well as
accusations the then-governor tried to shake down campaign contributions in
exchange for giving a state grant to a school, approving more state money for
a children's hospital, backing a major boost in tollway construction and
signing a bill to help the horseracing industry.

  
Gone from the first trial were some of the details that Zagel has described as
"bangles and beads," such as Blagojevich's alleged love of expensive suits and
habit of hiding in a bathroom from people he didn't want to see at his office.

  
But also removed were much more substantial allegations, including much of
what was known as Operation Board Games. That federal investigation centered
on efforts by Blagojevich fundraisers to influence appointments to state
boards and commissions, people whose votes they used to steer state business.

  
With the government's case winding down, it was ironic that there were
stretches in court Wednesday when it seemed like the retrial might never end.
Blagojevich's defense, struggling to assert its view that the conduct in the
case was happening in a political gray area, seemed to tear a page from last
summer's objection-filled proceedings

  
There were more than 100 objections during Blagojevich lawyer Sheldon
Sorosky's cross-examination of onetime staffer Alonzo "Lon" Monk, who
testified about his effort to squeeze campaign money from the owner of a pair
of Illinois horse tracks. Minutes sometimes went by without Monk's voice being
heard in the courtroom as Assistant U.S. Attorney Christopher Niewoehner
objected time and time again as Monk sat with his chin resting on his hand.

  
Sorosky was trying to suggest Blagojevich was just interested in raising money
and not intimidating anyone, but Zagel repeatedly chided him for arguing to
the jury through his questioning. The lawyer did manage to paint Monk as a rat
who first made money off his friendship with the governor and then turned on
him when he was charged.

  
The next witness, horseracing executive John Johnston, recounted a visit from
Monk just days before the governor's arrest. Blagojevich allegedly was holding
off on signing a bill to divert casino funds to the horseracing industry to
try to get Johnston to donate $100,000 to his campaign.

  
The two were in a stairwell at one of Johnston's tracks when Monk is alleged
to have given him a message from the governor.

  
"He turned to me and said, 'One more thing, I spoke with the governor, and
he's concerned if he signs the racing legislation, you won't be forthcoming
with a contribution,'" Johnston testified. "I said: 'I thought that's what the
governor might be thinking. The concept of a contribution at this point in
time is totally inappropriate.'"

  
The judge barred the defense from suggesting Johnston was used to making
campaign contributions to politicians who might help him, including some
$300,000 from his family to Blagojevich.
