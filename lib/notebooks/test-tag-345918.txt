CHICAGO --

A special prosecutor says a judge is biased and should be removed from the case
of police officers accused of covering up what happened when a white Chicago
officer fatally shot black teenager Laquan McDonald.  
  
Patricia Brown Holmes filed a motion Thursday in Cook County saying Judge Diane
Cannon is biased against the prosecution. Cannon would make the decision about
whether to bump herself off the case. If she refuses, Holmes can appeal.  

  
Thursday's motion offers no justification for the bias claim. Some attorneys
pointed to Cannon's 2015 acquittal of a police commander charged after allegedly
shoving a gun down a suspect's throat.  
  
Cannon was assigned to the McDonald case Monday after another judge recused
herself. The one current and two ex-officers in the McDonald case later pleaded
not guilty.
