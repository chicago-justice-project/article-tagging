noticed 0

A 0

It 0
sent 0

down 0

I 0
was 0
taken 0
aback 0
and 0
I 0
had 0
to 0
get 0
out 0

there 0

But 0
I 0
also 0
could 0
n't 0
stop 0
thinking 0
about 0
it 0

so 0
I 0
decided 0
I 0
had 0
to 0
buy 0
it 0
— 0
so 0
that 0
no 0
one 0
else 0
could 0
see 0
it 0

I 0
decided 0
that 0
I 0
wanted 0
it 0
out 0
of 0
circulation 0

'' 0
At 0
first 0
his 0
mission 0
was 0
clear 0
: 0
He 0
traveled 0
the 0
country 0
as 0
a 0
kind 0
of 0
hobby 0
, 0
hitting 0
every 0
antique 0
and 0
memorabilia 0
store 0
he 0
came 0
across 0
, 0
removing 0
from 0
circulation 0
every 0
derogatory 0
doll 0
, 0
postcard 0
and 0
whatnot 0
he 0
found 0
. 0
`` 0
But 0
because 0
of 0
the 0
range 0
and 0
depth 0
of 0
this 0
stuff 0
, 0
that 0
was 0
n't 0
realistic 0

I 0
did 0
n't 0
have 0
enough 0
money 0
to 0
save 0
the 0

So 0
he 0
became 0
discerning 0

an 0
early 0
aficionado 0
of 0

take 0
one 0
