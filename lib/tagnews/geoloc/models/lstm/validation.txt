up

Thursday

number
raised

to
blast

A
South
Side
teenager
allegedly
shot
and
seriously
wounded
a
video
game
buddy
because
he
expressed
no
interest
in
joining
a
gang
.
“
I
’
m
gon
na
do
what
I
have
to
do
,
”
Cook
County
prosecutors
said
River
Williams
proclaimed
before
shooting
the
15-year-old
victim
six
times
in
the
chest
,
arms
and
legs
.
“
It
’
s
over
for
you.
”
Minutes
before
on
Nov.
27
,
the
pair
had
been
playing
video
games
at
Williams
’
home
,
assistant
Cook
County
state
’
s
attorney
Joell
Zahr
said
.
Williams
’
father
later
took
the
two
boys
to
45th
and
Marshfield
where
Williams
greeted
four
Hispanic
males
and
shook
their
hands
,
Zahr
said
.
Williams
assured
his
friend
he
knew
the
group
and
they
all
went
to
a
nearby
park
,
Zahr
said
.
At
some
point
,
the
victim
saw
one
of
the
Hispanic
males
hand
Williams
a
gun
,
which
Williams
proceeded
to
place
in
his
waistband
and
cover
with
his
shirt
,
Zahr
said
.
Then
,
while
walking
to
a
store
at
46th
and
Damen
,
Williams
allegedly
asked
his
friend
if
he
wanted
to
be
a
“
Latin
Saint.
”
The
friend
said
,
“
no
,
”
but
Williams
,
15
,
repeated
the
question
,
Zahr
said
.
This
time
the
boy
froze
and
did
not
answer
,
prompting
Williams
to
fire
at
his
friend
,
Zahr
said
.
Williams
and
the
other
males
then
ran
away
as
the
victim
fell
to
the
ground
,
Zahr
said
.
The
injured
boy
was
eventually
able
to
get
up
and
walk
to
a
nearby
gas
station
and
seek
help
.
The
victim
,
who
had
to
undergo
multiple
surgeries
,
told
authorities
who
shot
him
,
Zahr
said
.
Williams
also
allegedly
admitted
to
a
family
member
that
he
had
shot
someone
.
Williams
,
of
the
6300
block
of
South
Vernon
,
was
previously
found
delinquent
as
a
juvenile
for
aggravated
robbery

man
was
critically
wounded
in
a
shooting
in
Chicago
's

said
two

,
died
of
smoke

been
ruled
homicides
by

Prosecutors
say
a
bizarre
spat
between
two
Manny

Deli
workers
started
when
one
pushed
the
other
while
he
was
loading
hot
gelatin
into
a
fridge
—
and
ended
with
part
of
an
ear
being
bitten
off
.
``

''
a
Cook
County
sheriff
's
deputy
said
to
the
alleged
ear
biter
as
he
led
him
out
of
court
Wednesday
,
referring
to
boxer
Mike
Tyson
's
notorious
chomping
of
Evander
Holyfield
's
ears
.
The
53-year-old
victim
now
hears
constant
ringing

is
``
permanently

''
since

reattach
the
earlobe

Sanchez
allegedly
``

his
co-worker
as
the
man
was
trying
to
load
a
container
of
hot
Jell-O
into
a
refrigerator

approached
the
victim
as
he
walked
to
work
in
the
1300
block
of
South
Jefferson
Street
,
demanding
to
``
finish
their
argument
,
''
according
to
Antonietti
.
Sanchez
took
off
his
belt
and
proceeded
to
whip
the
victim
,
prosecutors
said
.
He
then
bit
the
victim
's
ear
,
ripping
off
part
of
the
man
's
earlobe
,
court
records
show
.
``
The
victim
saw
a
part
of
his
ear
in
[
Sanchez
's

mouth
,
''
Antonietti
said
in
court
Wednesday
.
Both
men
then
went
to
work
,
prosecutors
said
,
and
the
victim
was
eventually
taken
to
a
nearby
hospital
.
According
to
Antonietti
,
the
man
needed
two
stitches
in
his
temple
and
will
need
``
more
medical
follow-up
''
for
his
ear
injury

left
one
man
dead

two
others
wounded

walked
up
and
shot
at
them
,

A
26-year-old

,
who
police
say
was
a
documented
gang
member
,
was
pronounced
dead
on

after
being
shot
in
his
chest
.
The

the
man
as
Eric

,
of
the

who
lives
a

doors
north
of
where
the
shooting
took

,
was
returning
home
after
dropping
her
two
children
off
at
school
.
Rivera
said
she
heard
gunshots
while
she
was
watching
television

``
I
checked
on
the
kids
and
10
minutes
later
,
the
body
was
in
middle
of
the
street

They
put
up
the
red
tape
up
right

Rivera
said
.
Though
her
children
,
age
12
and
7
,
slept
through
the
commotion
,
Rivera
said
herself
and
several
neighbors
gathered
outside
after
the
incident
.
``
For
the
most
part
it

PALATINE

(
WLS
)
--
Palatine
police
are
looking
for
a
man
a
girl
said
held
his
cell
phone
underneath
her
fitting
room
door
at
Target
.
Police
said
they
responded
to
the
Target
on
East
Dundee
Road
The
discovery
of
8-year-old
Gizzell
Ford
's
tortured
body
in
a
trash-strewn
Chicago
apartment
set
off
a
firestorm
of
shock
,
disgust
and
demands
for
change
.
Months
after
a
judge
ruled
against
the
child
's
mother
and
placed
Gizzell
in
her
grandmother
's
home
with
her
bedridden
father
,
the
straight-A
student
suffered
horrific
abuse
while
tied
to
a
bedpost
for
days
at
a
time
,
was
denied
food
and
water
,
and
punished
for
trying
to
take
a
sip
from
the
toilet
.
Gizzell
,
though
,
did
not
simply
fall
through
the
cracks
—
a
Chicago
Tribune
investigation
following
her
slaying
in
2013
found
that
multiple
layers
of
trained
professionals
duty-bound
to
protect
children
had
contact
with
the
emaciated
girl
in
the
final
months
of
her
life
but
failed
to
act
on
warning
signs
.
Now
,
as
the
child
's
grandmother
,
Helen
Ford
,
awaits
sentencing
following
her
recent
conviction
for
first-degree
murder
,
promises
of
systemic
reforms
in
Gizzell
's
memory
have
fallen
woefully
short
despite
some
incremental
improvements
in
training
and
collaboration
among
child
welfare
agencies
.
At
the
grandmother
's
trial
,
prosecutors
revealed
for
the
first
time
excerpts
from
the
rainbow-striped
journal
Gizzell
kept
over
the
summer
of
2013
as
she
endured
weeks
of
abuse
.
The
tone
,
once
hopeful
,
turned
dark
near
the
end
.
Gizzell
,
looking
forward
to
fourth
grade
,
wrote
that
she
was
``
a
beautiful
smart
and
good
young
lady
''
who
would
try
her
best
not
to
get
into
trouble
and
face
further
punishment
.
``
I
hate
this
life
because
now
I
'm
in
super
big
trouble
,
''
she
wrote
just
one
day
before
her
death
,
as
her
resiliency
finally
crumbled
amid
the
onslaught
of
verbal
,
emotional
and
physical
abuse
.
Attorneys
on
both
sides
of
the
case
agreed
on
this
much
—
that
a
Cook
County
domestic
relations
judge
should
never
have
placed
Gizzell
with
her
father
and
paternal
grandmother
,
both
unemployed
,
with
a
felony
conviction
in
each
of
their
backgrounds
.
Prosecutors
called
the
judge
's
ruling
``
a
disgrace
,
''
while
Ford
's
assistant
public
defenders
said
the
55-year-old
woman
was
overwhelmed
while
also
caring
for
her
quadriplegic
adult
son
and
two
young
grandsons
.
But
the
judge
was
far
from
the
only
one
who
missed
red
flags
,
interviews
and
records
obtained
by
the
Tribune
show
.
Barely
a
month
before
Gizzell
's
death
on
July
12
,
2013
,
an
investigator
for
the
Illinois
Department
of
Children
and
Family
Services
visited
the
grandmother
's
cockroach-infested
apartment
on
the
city
's
West
Side
as
she
checked
out
the
Fords
'
allegations
that
the
child
had
been
molested
by
her
mother
's
boyfriend
before
she
came
to
live
with
them
.
Prosecutors
said
bruises
and
wounds
over
her
entire
body
pointed
to
her
being
brutalized
for
weeks
,
but
the
DCFS
worker
reported
nothing
out
of
the
ordinary
beyond
a
cluttered
home
,
records
show
.
In
addition
,
a
respected
child-abuse
pediatrician
who
examined
Gizzell
for
the
possible
sexual
trauma
weeks
before
she
died
did
n't
call
the
DCFS

''
he
noted
on
the
girl
that
might
have
been
a
telltale
sign
of
abuse
.
The
doctor
also
may
not
have
followed
standard
protocol
in
cases
of
suspected
child
abuse
by
failing
to
question
Gizzell
privately
about
the
mark
outside
her
grandmother
's
presence
,
according
to
the
DCFS
Office
of
the
Inspector
General
.
Unable
to
find
evidence
of
sexual
trauma
,
he
characterized
the
exam
as
``
normal
''
but
noted
the
injury
and
two
other
marks
on
Gizzell
.
The
DCFS
investigator
had
access
to
the
physician
's
report
,
but
she
failed
to
act
as
well
.
Later
,
her
failures
in
Gizzell
's
care
led
to
her
firing
,
but
no
action
was
ever
taken
against
the
pediatrician
.
He
is
being
sued
,
however
,
by
Gizzell
's
mother
.
Equally
confounding
,
Gizzell
's
medical
exam
was
conducted
at
a
Children
's
Advocacy
Center
meant
to
provide
an
interdisciplinary
and
integrated
approach
to
child
abuse
allegations
,
yet
repeated
opportunities
for
collaboration
among
its
staff
,
the
pediatrician
and
DCFS
were
missed
.
News
of
Gizzell
's
suffering
outraged
state
and
local
officials
,
sparking
multiple
investigations
and
calls
for
action
that
for
the
most
part
have
produced
little
substantive
reform
.
For
instance
,
domestic
relations
judges
hearing
child
custody
disputes
between
impoverished
parents
who
ca
n't
afford
attorneys
still
are
forced
to
make
life-
or-death
decisions
with
few
resources
to
guide
them
.
And
DCFS
and
other
agencies
involved
in
child
welfare
still
often
operate
in
isolation
,
creating
communication
barriers
,
experts
say
.
DCFS
Director
George
Sheldon
,
hired
about
1
1/2
years
after
Gizzell
's
death
,
said
his
agency
``
should
have
seen
more
of
the
warning
signs
and
looked
deeper
,
with
a
greater
sense
of
urgency
about
the
risks
to
this
child
.
''
``
Regrettably
,
and
I
've
seen
this
too
many
times
,
everyone
failed
—
the
agency
,
the
doctor
,
the
courts
,
''
he
said
.
Sheldon
said
DCFS
is
making
progress
since
Gizzell
's
death
,
citing
innovations
in
technology
to
better
spot
red
flags
,
improved
training
and
pilot
projects
across
the
state
designed
to
localize
decision-making
and
shorten
how
long
kids
in
protective
custody
spend
in
temporary
placements
.
``
But
(
progress
)
is
slower
and
has
taken
more
time
than
anyone
would
hope
,

said
.

The

Johnson

there

a
much

afflicting

At

,
the
little
boy
kept
looking
down
at
the
wound
through
his
left
arm
.
Family
members
later
realized
the
boy
also
suffered
a
graze
wound
to
his
right
leg
.
“
He
wasn

crying

anything
,
”
Johnson
said
,
noting
that
his
son
was
released
after
a
night
in
the
hospital
.
“
He
’
s
strong.
”
Johnson
can
only
hope
his
son
finds
the
strength
to
recover
from
the
loss
of
his
mother
.
“
He
’
s
been

we
’
ve
been
taking
him
,
”
Johnson
said
.
“
His
understanding
is
,
mother
’
s
with
Jesus.
”
Having
a
child
so
young
endure
such
physical
and
emotional
pain
has
caused
Johnson
to
consider
leaving
Chicago
.
“
These

will
re-examine

of

,
who
police
shot
three
years
ago
on
the
West
Side
,
agency
spokeswoman
Mia
Sissac
said
.
McIntosh
's
family
has
filed
a
lawsuit
alleging
he
was
unarmed
when
police
chased
him
into
a
yard
and
shot
him
as
he
tried
to
surrender
.
Department
officials
said
at
the
time
of
the
shooting
that
officers
responded
to
a
call
of
armed
men
and
saw
suspects
matching
the
descriptions
they
'd
been
given
.
McIntosh
ran
off
,
and
an
officer
chased
and
shot
him
after
he
pulled
weapon
,
pointed
it
at
the
officer
and
refused
to
drop
it
,
police
officials
said
.
Top
IPRA
officials
decided
to
reopen
the
case
after
receiving
a
request
to
do
so
from
the
family
and
examining
the
original
investigation
,
Sissac
said
.
The
agency
determined
in
October
2015
that
shooting
was
within
department
policy
,
she
said
.
``
After
a
thorough
review
of
the
investigative
file
,
we
found
sufficient
reason
to
re-open
the
case
for
further
investigation
,
''
Sissac
said
in
a
written
statement
.
``
A
re-opened
case
is
not
an
indication
that
the
findings
will
be
modified
,
but
only
that
further
investigation
is
necessary
.

case
was
closed
just

Before
the
upheaval
stoked
by

McDonald
shooting
,
IPRA
had
ruled
that
only
two
out

shootings

violated
policy

scandal

resigned

Emanuel
appointed

An

every
Cracker

Ray
and
Wilma
Yoder
,

out
west
over
the
weekend
so
the
couple
could

645

Barrel
on
Monday
morning
at

even
put
up
a

little

Their
quest
began
40

ago
when
Ray
delivered
recreational
vehicles
across
the
country
for
Coachman
.
He
always
chose
to
eat
at
Cracker
Barrel
because
he
liked
the
food
,
and
more

,
he
liked
the
atmosphere
.
“
It
took
the
boredom
out
of
being
on
the
road
,
”
Ray
told
the
[
Lebanon

[

.
“
It
has
a
down-home
spirit
,
and
everybody
is
friendly
.
It
’
s
like
being
at
home.
”
His
wife
Wilma
eventually
joined

CHICAGO
—
A
26-year-old
man
was
shot
and
killed
in
Auburn
Gresham
on
Sunday
,
police
said
.
At
12:33
p.m.
,
the
man
was
in
the
8300
block
of
South
Justine
Street
My
first
reaction
to
most
things
I
learn
is
either
curiosity
or
its
cousin
,
healthy
skepticism
.
So
imagine
my
reaction
when
I
opened
the
Wrestling
Observer
newsletter
to
read
Bobby
``
The
Brain
''
Heenan
's
obituary
and
found
these
words
:
``
Once
,
in
Chicago
,
a
fan
fired
several
shots
at
him
.
Because
of
that
,
Heenan
was
also
quick
to
argue
with
people
who
would
say
that
the
old
days
were
better
,
noting
he
made
more
money
with
far
less
danger
as
time
went
on
.
''
Immediately
,
I
needed
to
learn
more
about
the
shooting
,
which
turned
out
to
be
one
of
those
``
only
in
wrestling
''
kind
of
stories
.
But
first
,
it
's
important
to
understand
that
pro
wrestling
is
a
vehicle
for
allegories
and
entertainment
,
like
all
theater
.
The
point
of
watching
men
strip
to
their
underwear
and
pretend
to
fight
is
knowing
it
's
a
melodrama
—
but
engaging
with
it
anyway
.
Every
wrestling
fan
has
been
teased
at
some
point
by
friends
who
ask
,
``
You
know
it
's
fake
,
right
?
''
And
the
answer
for
almost
all
of
us
is
``
yes
.
''
Sometimes
I
quote
the
great
wrestler
[
Mick
Foley
]
[
2
]
back
at
people
:
``
The
real
world
is
faker
than
wrestling
.
''
Like
when
I
watch
cable
newscasters
verbally
bodyslam
strawmen
or
see
a
web
link
to
a
clearly
partisan
website
get
regurgitated
as
fact
on
Facebook
.
Unlike
real
life
,
where
we
need
critical
thinking
skills
more
than
ever
to
distinguish
fake
news
from
reality
,
wrestling
is
supposed
to
be
about
accepting
what
you
see
and
having
fun
with
it
.
That
's
a
big
part
of
the
appeal
,
and
also
what
made
the
incident
at
an
American
Wrestling
Association
show
on
Jan.
25
,
1975
,
especially
intriguing
.

CHICAGO
—
A
man
was

in
South

morning
,

said
.
At

a.m.
,
the

CHICAGO
—
The
number
of
homicides
in
Chicago
in
October
was
significantly
lower
than
during
October
2016
,
but
2017
still
will
be
one
of
the
most
violent
years
in
recent
memory
for
the
city
.
The
Chicago
Police
Department
said
Wednesday
that
53
homicides
occurred
in
October
compared
to
80
in
October
2016
.
It
said
228
shooting
incidents
happened
last
month
compared
to
353
in
October
of
last
year
.
The
total
homicide
count
for
the
year
is
570
so
far
.
The
city
had
631
killings
by
this
time
last
year
.
Chicago
,
which
is
the
third-largest
city
in
the
U.S.
,
has
seen
2,445
shooting
incidents
so
far
this
year
compared
to
3,000
by
this
time
last
year
,
department
statistics
show
.
It
's
unlikely
that
2017
will
end
with
762
Chicago
homicides
as
it
did
in
2016
.
The
762
killings
was
the
highest
total
for
the
city
since
1997
and
more
than
the
combined
2016
totals
of
Los
Angeles
and
New
York
City
.
However
,
Chicago
is
almost
certain
to
pass
the
600
mark
for
homicides
for
just
the
second
time
in
14
years
.
And
with
two
months
left
in
the
year
,
the
number
of
shooting
incidents
has
already
eclipsed
the
total
for
all
of
2015
.
Police
said
some
of
the
drop
for
October
can
be
attributed
to
an
expanded
use
of
technology
that
helps
officers
respond
to
shootings
more
quickly
and
better
identify
areas
where
violence
might
occur
.
They
said
they
are
encouraged
by
the
fact
that
there
are
fewer
shooting
incidents
in
18
of
the
22
police
districts
compared
to
last
year
.
They
also
point
out
that
in
seven
of
those
districts
—
including
a
historically
violent
district
on
the
city
's
South
Side
At
least
five
people
were
killed
and
40
others
wounded
over
the
course
of
another
violent
weekend
in
Chicago
.
Of
those
shootings
,
1
person
was
killed
and
7
others
wounded
in
just
90
minutes
on
Saturday
night
.
The
first
fatal
shooting
of
the
weekend
occurred
around
4
p.m.
Friday
,
when
an
innocent

CHICAGO
—
Police
are
looking
for
a
man
who
tried
to
sexually
assault
a
woman
in
Armour
Square
early
Saturday
.
At

a.m.
,
the
woman
was
riding
her
bike
in
the
3200
block
of
South
Wells
Street

We
know
it
's
not
the
most
heinous
crime
.
But
it
's
a
crime
nonethele
ss
,
and
it
's
pretty
aggravating
.
We
're
talking
about
flower
thieves
.
As
CBS
2
’
s
Derrick
Blakley
reports
,
video
shows
one
caught
in
the
act
.
It
’
s
the
time
of
year
folks
love
to
display
the
beauty
of
their
flowers
.
It
’
s
also
when
others
,
apparently
,
love
to
steal
them
.
“
People
are
lazy
.
They
do
n't
want
to
work
,
they
just
want
to
steal
,
”
neighbor
Mary
Sigg
says
.
In
security
video
posted
online
a
brazen
nighttime
thief
pulls
up
to
the
curb
and
scurries
away
with
two
pots
of
flowers
.
It
happened
on
South
Ewing
,
just
a
few
doors
down
from
Sigg
.
“
Right
next
door
,
their
flowers
were
stolen
last
year
,
”
she
says
.
“
When
I
heard
this
happened
again
,
I
'm
like
now
I
have
to
bring
my
stuff
in
at
night
and
that
's
ridiculous.
”
Just
days
ago
,
over
in
Hegewisch
,
Gabriel
Barka
's
family
got
its
flowers
plucked
.
“
It
was
n't
like
it
was
a
little
flower
pot
.
They
took
a
whole
vase
,
”
he
says
.
“
It
’
s
causing
concern
,
”
he
adds
.
“
If
they
're
going
to
come
up
to
the
front
steps
to
steal
some
plants
,
the
next
step
is
they
're
going
to
come
through
the
door
,
too.

is
not

to

—
A
sergeant
with
the
Chicago
Police
Department
sprung
into
action
to
save
a
boy
from
drowning
at
a
graduation
party
,
but
said
given
the
recent
tragic
loss
of
officers
nationwide
that
she
can
not
claim
to
be
a
hero
.
Sgt
.
Cindy
Guerra
was
at
a
family
member
's
graduation
party
in
south
suburban
Orland
Park
Sunday
At
the
start
of
every
season
,
assistant
coach
Natalie
Schawel
sat
down
with
female
athletes
on
McHenry
High
School
's
boys
water
polo
team
to
have
what
she
called
``
the
girl
talk
,
''
making
sure
they
understood
that
it
was
a
tough
sport
with
plenty
of
physical
contact
.
There
was
never
a
problem
until
a
playoff
game
in
May
2015
,
when
a
McHenry
player
made
a
shocking
allegation
.
Rebecca
Dabrowski
,
a
senior
,
said
she
was
sexually
assaulted
beneath
the
water
by
a
boy
playing
for
Libertyville
High
School
.
Police
investigated
her
claim
but
closed
the
case
without
recommending
criminal
charges
,
saying
it
did
n't
appear
that
the
other
player
's
actions
were
intentional
.
Yet
repercussions
from
the
episode
are
still
coming
.
The
U.S.
Department
of
Education
is
looking
into
it
as
a
possible
violation
of
federal
discrimination
law
,
and
Dabrowski
gave
an
interview
with
ESPN
that
aired
over
the
weekend
,
saying
she
feared
that
the
other
player
``
was
n't
going
to
learn
his
lesson
.
''
Dabrowski
and
her
family
declined
to
speak
with
the
Tribune
,
but
the
night
before
the
report
aired
,
she
wrote
on
Facebook
that
she
had
decided
to
address
the
incident
to
advance
a
public
conversation
.
``
Now
instead
of
hiding
behind
the
awkwardness
and
the
pain
,
I
'm
going
to
try
to
help
not
only
women
,
but
everyone
as
a
community
try
to
see
what
sexual
assault
does
to
someone
,
''
she
wrote
.
``
Listen
to
my
story
tomorrow
and
do
n't
be
sad
,
be
inspired
to
make
a
change
.
''
McHenry
does
not
have
a
girls
water
polo
team
,
so
Dabrowski
and
a
handful
of
other
female
players
joined
the
boys
'
program
.
Dabrowski
had
no
issue
with
the
sport
's
physicality
,
even
when
she
seemed
to
be
the
target
of
extra
aggression

Chicago
is
making
scant
progress
in
its
ongoing
battle
against
rampant
youth
joblessness
,
new
statistics
show
,
though
there
is
a
modicum
of
good
news
.
The
share
of
20-
to
24-year-old
black
men
who
were
neither
working
nor
in
school
declined
modestly
between
2014
and
2015
,
from
a
dismal
47
percent
to
a
still-dismal
43
percent
,
according
to
a
report
set
to
be
presented
Monday
at
the
Chicago
Urban
League
's
annual
forum
on
the
youth
unemployment
crisis
.
But
even
more
sobering
are
long-term
data
showing
how
Chicago
came
to
be
a
national
leader
in
joblessness
among
young
people
,
particularly
young
black
people
living
in
the
highly
segregated
neighborhoods
wracked
by
violence
.
The
steep
decline
of
well-paying
manufacturing
jobs
,
the
rise
of
low-paying
retail
jobs
and
the
``
emptying
out
of
jobs
''
from
the
neighborhoods
as
commerce
centralized
downtown
changed
the
economic
structure
of
the
city
to
the
detriment
of
black
and
,
to
a
lesser
extent

at

[

and
co-author
of
the
report
,
said
it
's
easy
to
blame
individual
weaknesses
for
employment
struggles
,
but
the
trends
suggest
a
far
more
complex
challenge
that
demands
a
comprehensive
response
.
``
The
solutions
have
to
address
some
of
these
structural
dynamics
,
''
Cordova
said
.
``
More
than
ever
it
makes
the
case
about
why
this
is
everybody
's
problem
.
''
The
forum
,
in
its
sixth
year
,
comes
as
Chicago
draws
national
headlines
—
and
President
[
Donald
Trump
]
[
2
]
's
attention
—
for
soaring
violence
that
wo
n't
seem
to
quit
.
Chicago
experienced
its
worst
violence
in
two
decades
last
year
,
with
more
than
4,300
people
shot
and
762
killed
,
according
to
Police
Department
statistics
.
The
violence
has
continued
at
comparable
levels
so
far
in
January
.
Trump
tweeted
on
Tuesday
that
he
would
``
send
in
the
Feds
!
''
if
Chicago
does
n't
fix
the
``
carnage
,
''
though
it
was
n't
clear
if
he
meant
troops

another
kind
of
intervention

Cordova
had
a
suggestion
.
``
If
he
wants
to
involve
the

government
in

to
address
our
problem

then
send
us
federal
dollars
for

and
dollars
to
revitalize
our
neighborhoods

Joblessness
is
among
multiple
factors
contributing
to
Chicago
's
violence
,
the
report
said
.
Of
the
city
's
77
community
areas
,
just
five
accounted
for
a
third
of
the
homicides
last
year
,
and
those
same
five
had
jobless
rates
ranging
from
79
to
92
percent
for
teens
and
49
to
70
percent
for
young
adults
.
Joblessness
,
which
in
this
context
describes
anyone
who
is
not
working
,
is
not
the
same
as
unemployment
,
which
describes
those
who
are
not
working
but
are
actively
looking
for
work
.
Youth
have
said
at
past
forums
that
jobs
offer
income
and
exposure
to
opportunities
that
demonstrate
an
alternative
to
the
illegal
activities
happening
outside
their
doorsteps
.
They
also
have
said
jobs
are
difficult
to
land
.
Darron
Gunnings
,
18
,
who
is
one
of
six
young
people
scheduled
to
speak
at
Monday
's
forum
,
feels
lucky
that
his
mom
was
on
him
to
study
and
find
a
summer
job
,
because
many
of
his
peers
do
n't
have
that
influence
.
``
They
do
n't
come
from
that
kind
of
family
,
''
said
Gunnings
,
who
worked
summers
as
a
youth
leader
in
agriculture
at
UCan
,
a
social
services
organization
in
North
Lawndale
where
his
mom
works
.
Gunnings
,
who
lives
in
the
Altgeld
Gardens
public
housing
project
on
the
city
's
southern
edge
,
had
his
own
struggles
.
He
got
into
fights
,
and
was
placed
on
24-hour
house
arrest
for
a
summer
after
a
gun
was
found
in
his
backpack
at
school
.
He
said
he
had
taken
it
off
of
a
friend
who
brought
it
to
ward
off
bullies
who
tried
to
rob
students
heading
home
from
school
.
The
experience
changed
him
.
He
got
his
grades
up
and
committed
to
being
a
leader
.
Gunnings
,
who
belongs
to
several
youth
groups
,
also
credits
several
mentors
—
his
stepfather
taught
work
ethic
and
humility
,
his
basketball
coach
taught
him
how
to
look
people
in
the
eye
—
for
setting
him
on
a
solid
path
and
exposing
him
to
a
broader
world
.
Gunnings
,
who
is
on
track
to
graduate
from
Community
Christian
Academy
this
June
,
speaks
eagerly
of
visiting
the
green
landscapes
of
Ireland
,
the
cherry
blossoms
in
Japan
and
the
Hawaiian
reefs
.
Jack
Wuest
,
executive
director
of
the
Alternative
Schools
Network
,
which
commissioned
the
Great
Cities
report
,
worries
not
enough
kids
are
having
that
experience
.
A
lack
of
federal
funding
for
summer
jobs
has
left
kids
without
early
work
experience
and
the
elemental
skills
,
such
as
how
to
take
direction
or
show
up
on
time
,
that
make
them
good
employees
,
he
said
.
``
There
has
just
been
this
huge
gap
,
and
I
think
it
's
going
to
affect
the
economy
because
of
the
labor
shortages
businesses
already
are
talking
about
,
''
Wuest
said
.
Chicago
's
problems
with
youth
unemployment
have
stood
out
because
of
severe
racial
disparities
that
are
starker
than
in
cities
like
New
York
City
and
Los
Angeles
,
especially
among
20-
to
24-year-olds
.
On
most
measures
,
blacks
do
far
worse
and
whites
do
significantly
better
in
Chicago
than
in
those
cities
and
compared
with
national
averages
.
Chicago
's
Latino
youth
employment
rate
,
meanwhile
,
largely
mirrors
the
nation
's
.
Take
the
statistics
on
early
20-somethings
who
were
both
out
of
school
and
out
of
work
,
a
population
that
worries
policymakers
.
In
Chicago
in
2015
,
40
percent
of
young
blacks
fell
into
that
category
,
compared
with
7
percent
of
whites
and
21
percent
of
Hispanics
,
according
to
Great
Cities
.
Nationally
,
the
rate
was
25
percent
of
young
blacks
,
13
percent
of
whites
and
19
percent
of
Hispanics
.
The
racial
disparities
were
not
so
great
among
16-
to
19-year-olds
who
were
not
working
or
in
school
.
Thirteen
percent
of
black
Chicago
teens
and
6.3
percent
of
white
Chicago
teens
fell
into
that
category
,
both
a
notch
above
the
national
averages
,
and
8
percent
of
Hispanic
teens
,
a
notch
below
.
It
is
n't
clear
why
the
racial
gap
widens
so
drastically
after
the
teen
years
.
But
it
appears
that
it
has
gotten
worse
over
the
decades
.
The
economic
forces
driving
some
of
those
trends
can
be
traced
to
Chicago
's
heavy
reliance
on
manufacturing
jobs
and
their
steep
decline
,
according
to
the
Great
Cities
report
.
The
city
's
youth
were
more
likely
than
youth
nationally
to
work
in
manufacturing
,
so
the
industry
's
fall
hit
them
harder
,
particularly
Hispanics
.
The
jobs
that
filled
the
void
tell
the
other
part
of
the
story
.
By
2015
,
nearly
half
of
employed
black
20-
to
24-year-olds
and
40
percent
of
Hispanics
in
that
age
group
were
working
in
retail
,
compared
with
30
percent
of
whites
.
Whites
were
more
likely
to
work
in
professional
and
related
services
jobs
,
a
diverse
category
that
includes
hospitals
and
legal
services
.
Those
differences
were
felt
in
people
's
paychecks
.
More
than
70
percent
of
retail
jobs
held
by
early
20-somethings
in
2015
paid
less
than
$
20,000
.
That
compares
with
61
percent
of
professional
and
related
services
jobs
in
2015
and
just
36
percent
of
manufacturing
jobs
in
1960
.
The
earnings
of
youth
have
greatly
suffered
with
the
industry
shifts
,
the
report
said
.
No
longer
can
an
early
job
pay
for
a
home
,
bills
or
college
tuition
.
At
the
same
time
,
jobs
left
the
neighborhoods
,
which
leads
to
population
and
business
flight
that
compounds
community
hardships
,
according
to
Great
Cities
,
which
crunched
data
from
the
Illinois
Department
of
Employment
Security
.
Manufacturing
jobs
,
which
in
1970
were
present
in
all
Chicago
ZIP
codes
,
are
nearly
wiped
off
the
map
in
2015
.
Retail
jobs
,
which
in
1970
had
big
hubs
in
certain
South
and
West
side
neighborhoods

A
24-year-old
man
was
shot
Saturday
afternoon
in
the
South
Shore
neighborhood
on
the
South
Side
.
He
was
driving
at
2:41
p.m.
in
the
2800
block
of
East
76th
Street
Growing
up
in
Hyde

limited
Bryant
Gumbel
's
exposure
to
the
danger
he
now
finds
so
difficult
to
comprehend
in
his
hometown
.
``
Hyde
Park
was
a
rare
island
in
the
sea
of
Chicago
,
integrated
in
a
segregated
city
,
well-educated
in
a
blue-collar
town
,
populated
by
a
ton
of
immigrants
,
the
kind
of
neighborhood
someone
once
said
after
dinner
instead
of
watching
'I
Love
Lucy
,
'
you
read
Socrates
,
''
said
Gumbel
,
68
,
one
of
sports
'
most
intellectual
voices
.
``
I
do
n't
know
if
I
'd
go
that
far
,
but
everybody
read
,
got
along
and
took
pride
in
who
they
were
,
a
real
melting
pot
.
Once
you
left
the
neighborhood
,
you
saw
how
the
rest
of
the
world
is
.
…
But
it
seems
that
's
changed
,
too
,
there
.
''
Concerns
over
Chicago
's
violence
compelled
Gumbel
to
return
with
a
crew
from
his
HBO
show
,
``
Real
Sports
,
''
and
explore
,
among
other
things
,
a
rise
in
shooting
deaths
coinciding
with
the
decline
of
what
is
known
on
the
streets
as
``
The
Hooper
's
Pass
.
''
A
Hooper
's
Pass
used
to
exclude
gifted
basketball
players
from
the
gang
violence
that
victimized
so
many
other
teens
,
and
Gumbel
focused
on
recent
tragedies
at
Marshall
High
to
illustrate
how
things
have
changed
.
He
interviewed
Arthur

now
comes

When

Chicago

the

will
say
what

then
Chicago

just
as
Chicago

forgotten

Thanks
to
my
softball
teammate
and
writer
Jack
Silverstein
(
@
readjack
)
for
pointing
out
why
the
South
Side
of
Chicago
needs
more
attention
than
it
is
getting
.
Maybe
my
transplant
status
as
a
45-year
north
sider/north
suburban
resident
represents
a
naive
viewpoint
to
the
needs
and
history
of
Chicago
's
forgotten
landscape
.
But
,
I
'll
tell
you
,
when
you
have
lived
and
grown
up
on
the
North
Side
,
if
there
's
a
reference
to
the
South
Side
,
it
all
means
the
same
-
whether
it
's
Bridgeport
,
Burnside
or
Beverly
,
it
makes
no
difference
.
It
's
just
a
wave-off
-
``
Oh
yeah
,
that
happened
on
the
south
side
.
