**
(
CBS

--

We
know
it
's
not
the
most
heinous
crime
.
But
it
's
a
crime
nonethele
ss
,
and
it
's
pretty
aggravating
.
We
're
talking
about
flower
thieves
.
As
CBS
2
’
s
Derrick
Blakley
reports
,
video
shows
one
caught
in
the
act
.
It
’
s
the
time
of
year
folks
love
to
display
the
beauty
of
their
flowers
.
It
’
s
also
when
others
,
apparently
,
love
to
steal
them
.
“
People
are
lazy
.
They
do
n't
want
to
work
,
they
just
want
to
steal
,
”
neighbor
Mary
Sigg
says
.
In
security
video
posted
online
a
brazen
nighttime
thief
pulls
up
to
the
curb
and
scurries
away
with
two
pots
of
flowers
.
It
happened
on
South
Ewing
,
just
a
few
doors
down
from
Sigg
.
“
Right
next
door
,
their
flowers
were
stolen
last
year
,
”
she
says
.
“
When
I
heard
this
happened
again
,
I
'm
like
now
I
have
to
bring
my
stuff
in
at
night
and
that
's
ridiculous.
”
Just
days
ago
,
over
in
Hegewisch
,
Gabriel
Barka
's
family
got
its
flowers
plucked
.
“
It
was
n't
like
it
was
a
little
flower
pot
.
They
took
a
whole
vase
,
”
he
says
.
“
It
’
s
causing
concern
,
”
he
adds
.
“
If
they
're
going
to
come
up
to
the
front
steps
to
steal
some
plants
,
the
next
step
is
they
're
going
to
come
through
the
door
,
too.
”
This
is
not
a
phenomenon
limited
to
the
East
Side
.
Last
year
,
security
cameras
in
Lakeview
caught
folks
actually
digging
up
plants
in
a
front
yard
.

Corinne
Collins
and
her
three
children
considered
sleeping
in
a
friend
's
backyard
until
they
could
find
a
permanent
home
after
a
Friday
fire
left
their
apartment
uninhabitable
.
Collins
said
temporary
housing
money
from
the
[
Red
Cross
]
[
1
]
had
run
out
,
and
she
did
n't
want
to
take
her
children
to
a
homeless
shelter
.
On
Wednesday
,
the
[
Waukegan
]
[
2
]
Housing
Authority
notified
Collins
she
could
move
into
an
empty
unit
in
the
same
building
where
she
had
lived
before
the
fire
,
she
said
.
Waukegan
Fire
Marshal
Michael
Scholle
said
the
blaze
started
about
7:30
p.m.
inside
an
apartment
in
the
500
block
of
South
Genesee
Street
when
one
of
Collins
'
children
set
a
hair
extension
on
fire
while
playing
with
a
lighter
in
the
bathroom
.
The
6-year-old
panicked
and
threw
the
burning
material
into
a
bag
,
and
then
hid
the
bag
in
a
bedroom
closet
,
Scholle
said
.
``
I
thought
all
three
of
(
my
children
)
were
watching
television
downstairs
,
''
Collins
said
.
``
All
of
a
sudden
,
I
hear
the
smoke
detector
go
off
.
''
She
said
her
11-year-old
son
,
Pea
Collins
,
yelled
there
was
a
fire
,
and
they
all
ran
out
of
the
home
without
grabbing
anything
.
``
We
literally
just
ran
out
,
''
Collins
said
.
The
fire
left
the
apartment
uninhabitable
,
Scholle
said
.
Collins
said
she
had
received
money
from
the
Red
Cross
for
temporary
housing
,
but
that
ran
out
Monday
night
.
``
We
(
were
)
at
the
parking
lot
of
Walmart
in
Gurnee
trying
to
figure
out
where
we
will
go
''
she
said
on
Tuesday
.

What
caught
her
off
guard
was
the
help
from
neighbors
,
including
Chris
``
Brotha
''
Blanks
of
the
Black
Abolition
Movement
for
the
Mind
,
who
was
one
of
the
first
to
offer
her
cash
assistance
.
``
You
do
n't
realize
all
that
takes
place
when
something
like
this
happens
,
so
I
was
glad
that
Red
Cross
was
on
the
scene
quickly
,
''
Collins
said
.
``
They
provided
a
care
package
of
toiletries
,
blankets
,
hotel
and
incidental
funds
,
and
even
red
clown
noses
for
comic
relief
.
Their
presence
was
a
welcomed
one
on
a
night
that
should
have
been
the
beginning
of
a
fun
holiday
weekend
.
``
My
heart
was
especially
warmed
by
the
quick
response
of
the
community
.
We
literally
ran
out
of
the
house
half-dressed
,
and
my
neighbors
moved
quickly
,
providing
diapers
,
clothes
,
and
even
opening
their
homes
for
a
place
to
stay
and
regroup
.
''
By
Monday
,
the
gift
cards
Collins
used
for
a
hotel
were
exhausted
of
funds
,
and
she
said
she
began
to
wonder
what
she
was
going
to
do
with
her
family
.
On
Tuesday
,
Collins
said
she
thought
she
and
her
children
might
just
sleep
in
her
vehicle
.
``
Someone
suggested
going
to
the
homeless
shelter
,
but
I
do
n't
want
to
take
my
kids
there
,
''
she
said
.
Collins
said
another
friend
—
who
did
n't
have
room
inside
her
apartment
—
offered
a
tent
so
Collins
could
set
up
in
her
backyard
.
``
I
never
camped
out
in
my
life
,
''
Collins
said
.
``
I
guess
there
is
a
first
time
for
everything
.
''
The
family
did
n't
need
to
camp
because
another
friend
offered
Collins
and
the
children
shelter
,
she
said
.
Collins
said
the
reality
of
losing
her
home
to
fire
has
been
a
learning
experience
,
and
she
hopes
she
will
be
able
to
go
back
and
see
if
there
is
anything
salvageable
.
``
It
's
really
been
an
eye-opening
experience
,
''
she
said
.
``
It
can
be
a
bit
of
a
challenge
.
You
can
never
think
of
everything
.
''
She
's
also
been
confronted
by
some
people
.
``
I
've
had
people
lash
out
and
blame
me
.
'Maybe
if
I
was
n't
a
single
mom
with
three
kids
,
this
would
n't
have
happened
,
'
''
she
said
.
``
It
gives
me
a
different
kind
of
compassion
for
other
people
who
have
to
go
through
this
.
...
This
has
been
a
lot
to
deal
with
.
''
Scholle
said
Waukegan
fire
officials
would
be
contacting
Collins
to
see
if
she
and
her
child
would
attend
the
department
's
juvenile
fire
starter
counseling
sessions
.

You
will

According
to
prosecutors
,
Salaymeh
was
sitting
in
a
pick-up
truck
with
three
friends
at
a
red
light
near
Michigan
Avenue
and
24th
Street
when
a
silver
Saturn
pulled
up
alongside
the
truck
about
4
a.m.
June
6
.
That
car
was
driven
by
a
23-year-old
woman
,
prosecutors
said
.
Frausto
was
a
front-seat
passenger
,
and
two
others
sat
in
the
back
seat
.
Frausto
pulled
a
gun
,
reached
his
arm
in
front
of
the
Saturn
driver
—
and
while
holding
the
gun
roughly
18
inches
from
the
driver
's
face
—
fired
eight
shots
toward
the
pick-up
truck
,
Reardon
said
.
Frausto
then
slapped
the
Saturn
driver
on
the
back
of
her
head
and
said
,
``
Go
,
b
--
--
,
''
before
the
woman
drove
off
,
prosecutors
said
.
Salaymeh
was
shot
twice
in
his
torso
and
later
pronounced
dead
at
a
nearby
hospital
,
according
to
the
Cook
County
Medical
Examiner
's
Office
.
A
23-year-
old
passenger
in
the
pick-up
truck
was
shot
in
her
right
leg
and
survived
.
Frausto
and
his
three
companions
would
spend
the
next
several
hours
driving
around
,
prosecutors
said
.
Frausto
repeatedly
racked
the
slide
of
his
gun
,
boasted
about
the
shooting
and
called
himself
``
savage
,
''
according
to
Reardon
.
At
some
point
,
Frausto
collected
expended
shell
casings
and
threw
them
away
in
an
alley
,
prosecutors
said
.
He
also
hid
his
gun
under
the
roof
of
the
Saturn
before
telling
his
companions
that
he
'd
have
``
one
bullet
for
each
of
them
''
if
they
told
anyone
what
he
did
,
Reardon
said
.
Multiple
witnesses
identified
Frausto
as
the
shooter
.
He
was
arrested
July
8
on
a
warrant
in
Michigan
.
Police
on
the
scene
found
a
handgun
and
loaded
magazine
in
the
bedroom
where
Frausto
was
staying
,
prosecutors
said
.
Frausto
,
of
suburban
Countryside

is
charged
with

The
man
has
previous
convictions

An
iconic
all-night
South
Loop
dine
r
exploded
in
gunfire
Saturday
as
an
early
morning
quarrel
turned
into
a
shootout
,
authorities
said
.
No
one
was
injured
at
the
shooting
inside
the
White
Palace
Grill
in
the
1100
block
of
South
Canal
Street
,
according
to
Chicago
police
.
About
6:30
a.m.
,
two
men
were
arguing
when
they
both
pulled
out
handguns
and
fired
shots
at
each
other
,
police
said
.
No
one
was
struck
,
but
several
windows
in
the
business
,
including
an
glass
vestibule
,
were
shot
out
.
It
was
unclear
how
many
customers
were
inside
at
the
time
.
Just
hours
later
,
the
shooting
did
not
appear
to
affect
business
as
more
than
a
dozen
diners
were
eating
in
booths
,
as
a
waitress
spoke
with
two
Chicago
police
officers
.
A
man
who
described
himself
as
a
manager
declined
to
comment
.
“
I
’
ve
told
the
police
,
I
’
ve
told
everyone
.
I
don
’
t
want
to
talk
about
it
anymore
,
”
he
said
,
as
wait
staff
served
diners
around
him
.
A
mainstay
at
the
intersection
of
Roosevelt
Road
and
Canal
Street
since
1939
,
the
old-school
White
Palace
diner
has
become
a
frequent
stop
for
late-night
bar
hoppers
that
over
the
years
has
served
celebrities
such
as
Bono
and
Bulls
legend
Michael
Jordan
.
No
arrests
have
been
made
in
the
shooting

BRONZEVILLE
—
A
sergeant
with
the
Chicago
Police
Department
sprung
into
action
to
save
a
boy
from
drowning
at
a
graduation
party
,
but
said
given
the
recent
tragic
loss
of
officers
nationwide
that
she
can
not
claim
to
be
a
hero
.
Sgt
.
Cindy
Guerra
was
at
a
family
member
's
graduation
party
in
south
suburban
Orland
Park
Sunday
when
a
young
girl
ran
up
and
said
her
cousin
was
at
the
bottom
of
the
home
's
pool
,
Guerra
told
reporters
outside
police
headquarters
in
Bronzeville
Monday
.
``
I
saw
this
young
man
at
the
bottom
of
the
pool
,
''
Guerra
said
.
``
I
Immediately
went
in
and
grabbed
him
.
''
The
boy
,
who
is
12
or
13-years-old
,
Guerra
said
,
was
not
breathing
,
so
she
performed
CPR
on
the
boy
until
he
began
to
breathe
and
his
heart
began
to
beat
.
Paramedics
came
shortly
after
she
was
able
to
resuscitate
the
boy
,
Guerra
said
.
The
boy
,
who
is
not
related
to
Guerra
,
is
expected
to
recover
,
Guerra
said
.
Guerra
,
a
22-year-veteran
of
the
department
,
said
her
decision
to
jump
into
the
pool
with
clothes
and
shoes
on
was
probably
due
to
her
day
job
and
time
spent
as
a
life
guard
many
years
ago
,
but
admitted
not
much
thought
was
put
into
the
decision
.
She
also
said
that
she
had
previously
taught
a
CPR
class
.
``
I
did
n't
think
,
''
she
said
.
``
I
have
a
son
that
's
the
same
age
.
''
Her
actions
naturally
lead
to
labels
of
'hero
,
'
but
Guerra
said
she
dismisses
such
talk
given
the
recent
attacks
on
officers
in
Dallas
and
Baton
Rouge
,
where
three
officers
were
fatally
shot
Sunday
.
She
said
the
``
real
heroes
''
were
the
officers
in
Dallas
and
Baton
Rouge
who
died
in
the
line
of
duty
.
``
The
hero
pill
is
a
little
hard
to
swallow
given
the
current
climate
,
''
she
said
.
``
So
many
officers
perform
heroic
acts
every
day
.

At
the
start
of
every
season
,
assistant
coach
Natalie
Schawel
sat
down
with
female
athletes
on
McHenry
High
School
's
boys
water
polo
team
to
have
what
she
called
``
the
girl
talk
,
''
making
sure
they
understood
that
it
was
a
tough
sport
with
plenty
of
physical
contact
.
There
was
never
a
problem
until
a
playoff
game
in
May
2015
,
when
a
McHenry
player
made
a
shocking
allegation
.
Rebecca
Dabrowski
,
a
senior
,
said
she
was
sexually
assaulted
beneath
the
water
by
a
boy
playing
for
Libertyville
High
School
.
Police
investigated
her
claim
but
closed
the
case
without
recommending
criminal
charges
,
saying
it
did
n't
appear
that
the
other
player
's
actions
were
intentional
.
Yet
repercussions
from
the
episode
are
still
coming
.
The
U.S.
Department
of
Education
is
looking
into
it
as
a
possible
violation
of
federal
discrimination
law
,
and
Dabrowski
gave
an
interview
with
ESPN
that
aired
over
the
weekend
,
saying
she
feared
that
the
other
player
``
was
n't
going
to
learn
his
lesson
.
''
Dabrowski
and
her
family
declined
to
speak
with
the
Tribune
,
but
the
night
before
the
report
aired
,
she
wrote
on
Facebook
that
she
had
decided
to
address
the
incident
to
advance
a
public
conversation
.
``
Now
instead
of
hiding
behind
the
awkwardness
and
the
pain
,
I
'm
going
to
try
to
help
not
only
women
,
but
everyone
as
a
community
try
to
see
what
sexual
assault
does
to
someone
,
''
she
wrote
.
``
Listen
to
my
story
tomorrow
and
do
n't
be
sad
,
be
inspired
to
make
a
change
.
''
McHenry
does
not
have
a
girls
water
polo
team
,
so
Dabrowski
and
a
handful
of
other
female
players
joined
the
boys
'
program
.
Dabrowski
had
no
issue
with
the
sport
's
physicality
,
even
when
she
seemed
to
be
the
target
of
extra
aggression

Schawel

But
in
the
first
game
of
the
2015
playoffs
,
held
at
Buffalo
Grove
High
School
,
she
was
matched
against
a
Libertyville
player
she
said
had
ridiculed
her
during
an
earlier
game
.
She
told
ESPN
that
the
boy
touched
her
breasts
outside
of
her
suit
while
he
was
guarding
her
,
and
when
they
were
later
paired
off
again
,
he
went
even
further
.
``
He
...
ripped
my
suit
over
and
was
touching
me
underneath
the
water
,
''
she
said
,
describing
how
the
player
yanked
her
swimsuit
aside
with
one
hand
and
touched
her
genitals
with
the
other
.
Dabrowski
said
she
let
out
a
yelp
but
kept
playing
,
though
she
then
fouled
the
player
and
had
to
sit
out
.
Footage
said
to
be
from
the
match
showed
Dabrowski
crying
at
the
edge
of
the
pool
,
and
she
said
she
told
Schawel
that
the
other
player
had
touched
her
.
Schawel
told
the
Tribune
that
Dabrowski
had
never
before
complained
about
inappropriate
contact
.
``
That
was
crossing
the
line
,
''
said
Schawel
,
who
now
teaches
at
Lake
Forest
Academy
.
``
There
's
no
doubt
in
my
mind
that
crossed
the
line
.
I
coached
for
four
years
,
and
there
's
no
need
for
that
to
happen
in
a
game
.
''
According
to
a
report
released
Tuesday
by
the
Buffalo
Grove
Police
Department
,
Dabrowski
also
told
the
head
coach
,
Craig
Fowles
,
that
she
had
been
touched
inappropriately
.
He
confronted
Libertyville
's
coach
,
Ivan
Munoz
,
at
halftime
,
asking
,
``
What
are
you
teaching
your
players
?
''
Munoz
said
the
player
claimed
that
nothing
had
happened
,
but
Munoz
benched
him
anyway
for
throwing
a
water
bottle
during
a
break
.
Dabrowski
told
police
that
Munoz
approached
her
after
the
game
and
said
,
``
I
pulled
him
for
you
.
''
Neither
coach
could
be
reached
for
comment
.
After
working
as
a
part-time
coach
at
Libertyville
High
for
five
years
,
Munoz
resigned
at
the
end
of
the
2015
season
for
``
unrelated
reasons
,
''
a
Community
High
School
District
128
spokeswoman
said
.
The
police
investigation
began
two
days
after
the
game
,
when
Dabrowski
and
her
parents
went
to
Buffalo
Grove
police
and
said
the
Libertyville
player
had
reached
into
her
bathing
suit
and
touched
her
genitals
and
buttocks
.
According
to
the
police
report
,
Dabrowski
``
advised
that
no
penetration
took
place
.
''
On
the
ESPN
segment
,
she
said
the
Libertyville
player
had
penetrated
her
with
his
fingers
.
The
investigator
spoke
to
the
player
a
few
weeks
later
,
and
he
denied
touching
Dabrowski
inappropriately
,
according
to
the
report
.
The
player
's
mother
gave
the
investigator
a
video
of
the
game
,
and
he
wrote
in
the
report
that
it
was
impossible
to
see
what
happened
underwater
.
After
telling
Dabrowski
's
mother
he
``
was
unable
to
determine
if
(
the
player
's
)
actions
were
intentional
or
if
contact
was
accidental
,
''
he
closed
the
case
in
July
2015
.
Dabrowski
,
now
a
student
at
Monmouth
College
,
told
ESPN
that
she
started
seeing
a
therapist
after
the
incident
,
and
that
she
became
self-conscious
of
how
she
dressed
and
wary
of
speaking
with
males
,
even
her
father
.
``
It
destroyed
me
because
he
was
going
to
get
away
with
it
,
''
she
said.
``
…
All
I
wanted
was
for
him
to
go
to
counseling
.
I
just
want
to
make
sure
this
was
n't
going
to
happen
to
another
woman
.
''
A
man
who
identified
himself
as
the
father
of
the
Libertyville
player
called
Dabrowski
's
allegation
frivolous
.
``
Police
investigated
and
closed
the
case
,
so
we
view
this
as
a
closed
matter
,
''
he
said
.
``
It
was
unsupportable
at
the
time
.
''
ESPN
said
Dabrowski
filed
a
Title
IX
complaint
with
the
U.S.
Department
of
Education
's
Office
of
Civil
Rights
,
asking
them
to
investigate
whether
McHenry
,
Libertyville
and
the
Illinois
High
School
Association
responded
appropriately
to
her
allegation
.
The
department
said
it
had
opened
sexual
violence
investigations
at
the
two
school
districts
and
the
IHSA
,
though
it
declined
to
outline
the
claims
.
It
is
looking
into
90
other
school
sexual
violence
cases
nationwide
.
IHSA
Executive
Director
Craig
Anderson
said
the
police
investigation
stifled
the
association
's
review
.
``
Despite
our
limited
role
,
we
feel
confident
that
we
handled
things
appropriately
,
and
will
await
the
results
of
the
Title
IX
review
to
know
what
and
how
we
could
improve
our
response
should
an
incident
like
this
ever
occur
again
in
the
future
,
''
he
said
.
The
District
128
spokeswoman
made
a
similar
claim
,
saying
it
held
off
on
its
examination
until
the
police
investigation
was
over
.
By
that
time
,
she
said
,
the
student
had
graduated
and
was
no
longer
under
its
jurisdiction
.
Officials
with
McHenry
High
School
District
156
declined
to
address
the
case
,
pointing
to
a
statement
on
the
district
website
that
says
it
investigates
all
allegations
of
misconduct
and
wishes
Dabrowski
the
best

A
violent
confrontation
on
the
Near
South
Side
that
left
a
man
dead
and
a
police
officer
wounded
began
when
a
woman
walking
her
dog
became
suspicious
as
the
man
sat
drinking
in
a
park
.
Amani
Abou
Harb
,
25
,
said
she
was
with
a
friend
when
they
noticed
Derek
Love
,
50
,
drinking
beer
and
watching
three
young
girls
play
ball
at
the
Battle
of
Fort
Dearborn
Park
in
the
1800
block
of
South
Calumet
Avenue
around
8
p.m.
Thursday
.
“
We
were
there
for
over
an
hour
,
''
she
said
Friday
.
``
He
didn
’
t
have
a
dog
with
him
,
he
was
just
drinking
.
He
was
basically
watching
them
and
looking
at
us
.
...
You
sometimes
get
a
gut
feeling
that
this
person
…
isn
’
t
acting
normally
.
He
didn
’
t
say
anything
but
it
was
the
way
he
was
looking
at
us
and
the
girls.
”
Harb
said
she
approached
the
girls
and
advised
them
to
leave
.
Once
they
left
,
she
said
the
man
approached
her
and
her
friend
.
“
He
said
,
‘
You
girls
aren
’
t
getting
ready
to
leave
,
are
you
?
’
I
took
that
to
be
kind
of
.
...
I
just
didn
’
t
feel
safe
.
I
thought
I
’
d
report
him
.
He
might
get
more
and
more
intoxicated
,
so
I
thought
I
’
d
bring
the
matter
to
police
attention.
”
She
and
her
friend
went
in
search
of
police
but
only
found
an
empty
squad
car
.
They
kept
searching
and
eventually
saw
three
officers
on
bikes
about
a
block
from
the
park
.
“
They
asked
where
he
was
and
what
he
looked
like
.
It
was
really
quick
,
”
she
said
.
“
They
cycled
there
.
In
under
two
minutes
,
I
heard
the
shots.
”
A
Chicago
police
officer
assigned
to
bike
patrol
was
shot
in
the
leg
and
a
suspect
was
killed
in
an
exchange
of
gunfire
at
a
Near
South
Side
park
about
8
p.m.
on
July
21
,
2016
.
(
Chicago
Tribune
)
Harb
said
she
didn
’
t
see
the
exchange
between
Love
and
police
,
but
heard
8
or
9
gunshots
.
The
officer
was
hit
in
the
leg
and
was
taken
by
other
officers
to
Northwestern
Memorial
Hospital
,
where
he
was
treated
and
released
overnight
.
He
's
a
17-year
veteran
of
the
force
assigned
to
bike
patrol
in
the
Central
District
.
The
man
killed
by
police
was
identified
Friday
morning
as
Derek
Love
,
50
.
He
was
pronounced
dead
at
Northwestern
at
8:49
p.m.
Family
members
said
he
had
been
visiting
his
mother
who
lives
nearby
and
was
headed
to
his
home
in
Bronzeville
about
two
miles
away
.
Police
Superintendent
Eddie
Johnson
said
the
three
officers
had
found
Love
on
his
cellphone
in
the
park
.
The
officers
asked
him
to
get
off
the
phone
and
talk
to
them
,
but
instead
he
reached
into
a
backpack
and
started
firing
,
Johnson
said
.
The
wounded
officer
was
able
to
apply
a
tourniquet
to
his
leg
with
the
help
of
his
partner
,
probably
saving
his
life
,
Johnson
said
.
The
officer
had
received
training
in
emergency
medical
treatment

Johnson
said

For

Police
said
the
officers
were
not
wearing
body
cameras
,
and
it
was
not
known
if
the
shooting
was
caught
on
video
.
Love
has
a
record
of
arrests
going
back
to
1996
,
on
charges
ranging
from
weapons
possession
and
forgery
to
battery
and
disorderly
conduct
,
but
his
most
recent
arrest
was
in
2000
.
Most
of
the
charges
against
him
were
dropped
and
he
had
never
been
sentenced
to
prison
,
receiving
only
probation
on
a
felony
weapons
charge
from
1996
.
Harb
said
some
comments
on
the
Internet
have
blamed
her
for
Love
's
death
.
“
It
’
s
not
my
fault
what
happened
.
I
just
reported
something
that
I
saw
that
was
worth
being
reported
,
''
she
said
.
``
That
’
s
what
police
are
there
for
.
If
you
can
’
t
tell
them
,
then
I
don
’
t
know
what
you
’
re
supposed
do
.
''
Harb
moved
to
Chicago
last
year
and
is
working
on
her
master
’
s
degree
in
public
policy
at
the
University
of
Chicago
.
She
was
born
and
raised
in
Lebanon
,
and
received
a
bachelor
’
s
and
master
’
s
degree
in
English
literature
before
switching
career
paths
.
``
If
you
feel
like
you
’
re
seeing
something
suspicious
that
could
potentially
put
other
people
in
danger
,
the
way
you
should
respond
is
,
to
get
the
people
there
out
of
harm
’
s
way
and
report
it
and
let
professionals
deal
with
it
,
”
Harb
said
.
“
Clearly
I
didn
’
t
walk
up
to
the
guy
and
ask
him
,
'Hey
,
why
are
you
here
?
Why
are
you
drinking
?
'
I
just
made
sure
the
park
was
cleared
and
the
girls
went
home
.
And
I
told
the
cops
because
figured
it
’
s
their
job
to
deal
with
it
.
”

After
a
spike
in
crime
,
two
Chicago
aldermen
want
to
bring
private
security
services
to
the
Wicker
Park
and
Bucktown
neighborhoods
to
supplement
what
police
are
already
doing
.
Ald
.
Brian
Hopkins
(
2nd
)
and
Ald
.
Joe
Moreno
(
1st
)
proposed
a
plan
to
use
the
taxpayer
surplus
Special
Service
Area
,
or
SSA
,
funds
for
guards
to
help
Chicago
police
patrol
the
Northwest
Side
communities
.
On
Friday
,
the
aldermen
and
14th
District
Police
Commander
Fabian
Saldana
brought
together
dozens
of
residents
to
discuss
the
proposal

Moreno
said
.
Since
May
,
1700
crimes
from

were
reported
in
the

The

noted
that
Schock
insisted
in
that
news
conference
“
The
government
realized
there
was
no

;
the
government
attempted
to
manufacture
a

Schock
has
requested
that
his
trial
be
moved
to
Peoria
,
rather
than
Springfield
where
it
is
currently
slated
to
be
held

The

opposes
that
move
,
suggesting
that

is
already

Chicago
Police
Department
CHICAGO
—
The
daughter
of
a
[
man
who
died
while
detained
]
[

]
at
the
Jefferson
Park
District
police
station
last
year
has
filed
a
lawsuit
claiming
negligence
against
the
officers
and
detention
workers
who
were
on
duty
.
The
lawsuit
targets
two
officers
,
three
detention
aides
and
the
City
of
Chicago
,
who
attorneys
claim
lead
``
employees
to
believe
their
actions
will
never
be
scrutinized
,
thereby
encouraging
future
abuses
.
''
Just
after
midnight
on
June
2
,
2015
,
Johnny
Lopez
was
arrested
in
the
4100
block
of
West
Eddy
Street
in
Old
Irving
Park
and
charged
with
battery
,
according
to
Chicago
Police
Department
records
.
Lopez
,
41
,
was
brought
to
Community
First
Hospital
and
treated
for
dog
bites
before
being
taken
to
the
police
station
at
5151
,
N.
Milwaukee
Ave
.
,
and
locked
in
a
one-person
cell
,
according
to
a
complaint
filed
Dec.
9
by
Merary
Lopez
,
Johnny
Lopez
's
daughter
.
Around
3
p.m.
,
Lopez
passed
out
in
his
cell
,
prompting
another
inmate
to
``
bang
on
the
door
of
his
cell
and
yell
''
that
Lopez
needed
help
,
the
suit
said
.
But
officers
ignored
the
man
and
``
did
nothing
except
pass
out
sandwiches
to
other
inmates
,
''
despite
their
responsibility
to
``
conduct
visual
inspections
''
every
15
minutes
,
the
document
continues
.
A
detective
went
into
Lopez
's
cell
at
8:04
p.m.
,
the
suit
said
.
Lopez
was
then
brought
to
Northwestern
Memorial
Hospital
,
where
he
was
pronounced
dead
.
The
Cook
County
Medical
Examiner
's
Office
has
ruled
Lopez
's
death
an
accident
,
calling
it
the
result
of
``
hypertensive
cardiovascular
disease
''
mixed
with
``
recent
cocaine
use
.
''
The
lawsuit
accuses
the
two
officers
and
three
lockup
workers
of
``
unreasonable
treatment
,
''
saying
they
``
failed
to
provide
him
with
necessary
medical
attention
.
''
It
repeatedly
call
their
actions
``
unjustified
and
unconstitutional
,
''
in
violation
of
the
Constitution
's
4th
and
14th
amendments
.
The
lawsuit
focuses
on
the
Chicago
Police
Department
's
leaders
and
culture
,
which
``
directly
encourage
...
the
very
type
of
conduct
at
issue
here
by
failing
to
adequately
train
,
supervise
and
control
its
officers
.
''
The
lawsuit
seeks
an
unspecified
amount
in
damages
.
A
spokesman
for
the
city
's
Law
Department
declined
to
comment
on
the
lawsuit
.

The
final
phase
of
evacuations
from
former
rebel
strongholds
in
eastern
Aleppo
got
underway
Wednesday
,
with
some
families
huddling
around
fires
amid
sleet
and
snow
as
they
prepared
for
their
departure
from
the
war-torn
city
.
[
The
International
Committee
of
the
Red
Cross

[

said
all
patients
and
those
needing
medical
care
had
been
moved
out
of
the
last
hospital
in
the
east
Wednesday
evening
.
Once
the
evacuations
are
completed
,
the
government
can
assume
full
control
of
Aleppo
,
more
than
four
years
after
opposition
fighters
seized
large
areas
of
what
was
once
Syria
's
largest
city
.
Syrian
opposition
fighters
agreed
last
week
to
surrender
their
last
foothold
in
the
city
,
marking
the
most
significant
victory
for
President
[
Bashar
Assad
]
[
2
]
since
an
uprising
against
his
family
's
four-decade
rule
swept
the
country
in
2011
.
The
deal
followed
a
punishing
offensive
by
government
troops
and
military
allies
Russia
and
Iran
that
drove
out
tens
of
thousands
of
civilians
from
rebel-held
areas
of
the
city
.
Thousands
of
fighters
and
civilians
—
with
estimates
ranging
between
18,000
and
25,000
—
have
been
bused
out
of
eastern
Aleppo
since
the
evacuations
began
last
week
.
The
opposition
's
Britain
-based
Syrian
Observatory
for
Human
Rights
said
Wednesday
that
some
3,000
fighters
and
civilians
were
still
awaiting
evacuation
from
the
city
's
last
opposition-held
neighborhoods
,
where
some
60
buses
were
to
transport
them
out
.

A
convoy
of
buses
and
cars
later
drove
out
of
the
city
under
heavy
snow
.
By
Wednesday
evening
,
25
buses
from
eastern
Aleppo
had
reached
the
government-
held
western
outskirts
of
the
city
,
said
opposition
activist
Ahmad
Primo
.
He
spoke
to
The
Associated
Press
from
the
Rashideen
area
,
where
he
was
monitoring
the
arrivals
.
The
bus
movements
came
after
evacuations
had
been
suspended
for
24
hours
.
Syrian
state
TV
said
they
had
resumed
after
rebels
handed
over
prisoners
taken
in
previous
rounds
of
fighting
.
As
part
of
a
wider
deal
,
rebels
are
supposed
to
allow
evacuations
of
the
sick
and
wounded
from
two
rebel-besieged
villages
,
Foua
and
Kfarya
.
The
ICRC
said
about
750
people
have
already
been
bused
out
of
the
villages
,
leaving
hundreds
more
to
evacuated
.
Meanwhile
,
freezing
temperatures
worsened
already
dire
conditions
in
eastern
Aleppo
,
where
months
of
heaving
bombardments
have
caused
large-scale
devastation
.
Activists
circulated
photos
on

of
families
huddled
around
fires

MOUNT
VERNON
,
N.Y.
(
AP
)
--
A
suspect
is
in
custody
after
a
nightclub
shooting
in
Mount
Vernon
,
N.Y.
,
early
Christmas
Day
that
left
the
club
's
owner
dead
and
five
other
people
injured
.
The
shooting
happened
at
The
Mansion
,
a
club
on
North
3rd
Avenue
.
Police
said
the
victims
were
found
in
the
club
's
lobby
and
on
the
street
outside
.
It
was
supposed
to
be
a
festive
night
of
holiday
partying
in
Mount
Vernon
,
but
by
Sunday
morning
it
had
turned
to
absolute
grief
.
``
It
is
a
dark
day
in
our
city
.
No
person
,
no
family
should
ever
spend
Christmas
like
this
,
''
said
Mount
Vernon
Mayor
Richard
Thomas
.
The
mayor
's
office
in
Mount
Vernon
confirmed
that
just
before
4:30
a.m.
,
well-
known
nightclub
owner
O'neal
Bandoo
was
gunned
down
at
the
club
that
he
and
his
wife
operate
.
Security
guards
were
able
to
tackle
the
suspect
,
and
police
arrived
seconds
later
to
arrest
him
.
It
happened
when
the
club
was
closing
.
``
It
appears
he
may
have
been
ejected
from
the
club
.
I
do
n't
know
what
led
to
the
ejection
,
''
said
Mount
Vernon
Police
Captain
Edward
Adinaro
.
``
Right
now
my
daughter
is
devastated
,
''
said
Bandoo
's
father-in-law
Patrick
Merchant
,
and
he
too
suggests
the
reason
for
the
violence
stemmed
from
the
gunman
being
asked
to
leave
.
``
And
the
guy
like
,
retaliated
and
just
start
shooting
upon
the
front
,
you
know
what
I
mean
?
,
''
said
Merchant
.
Police
say
the
injured
were
taken
to
area
hospitals
with
non-life
threatening
injuries
.
But
the
grim
sight
of
the
Medical
Examiner
van
outside
the
club
hours
later
cast
a
dark
cloud
over
the
community
.
``
My
city
,
where
I
was
born
and
raised
,
is
not
getting
any
better
,
''
said
Mount
Vernon
resident
Raymond
Coleman
.
``
The
City
Council
has
un-funded
police
positions
,
which
I
'm
sure
,
has
led
to
a
spike
in
violent
crimes
like
these
,
this
year
,
''
said
Captain
Adinaro
.

Police
are
investigating
the
armed
robbery
of
a
grocery
store
on
Thursday
afternoon
in
north
suburban
Waukegan
.
About
1
p.m.
,

to
an
armed
robbery
of
a
grocery
store
in
the
600
block
of
Franklin

,
according
to
a
statement
from
Waukegan
police
.
When
they
arrived
,
store

told
them
they
were
robbed
at
gunpoint
.
Employees
said
that
someone
armed
with
a

and
demanded
money
before
driving
away
in
a
dark
,
small
or
mid-size
SUV
,
police
said
.
He
was
described
as
a
5-foot-10

male
with
a
medium
build
and
wearing
gray
sweatpants
with
a
white
string

Area
North
detectives
are
questioning
two
people
in
connection
with
the
shooting
who
were
taken
into
custody
after
crashing
their
vehicle
in
west
suburban
Oak
Park
.

CHICAGO
--
Chicago
police
are
looking
for
a
driver
who
swerved
around
a
crowd
of
people
and
ran
over
a
woman
who
had
collapsed
in
the
middle
of
the
street
,
killing
her
,
before
speeding
off
Monday
morning
.
The
Cook
County
Medical
Examiner
identified
the
woman
as
52-year-old
Annette
Crosby
,
who
lives
blocks
away
from
the
spot
of
the
accident
,
according
to
the
M.E
.
's
records
.
It
was
still
dark
out
around
6:15
a.m.
Monday
,
as
surveillance
footage
from
a
gas
station
in
the
Austin
neighborhood
shows
.
Video
shows
a
woman
crossing
the
street
suddenly
collapse
in
the
middle
of
the
road
.
Soon
after
,
a
car
slowly
approached
the
woman
and
stopped
.
John
Moore
said
he
was
waiting
for
a
bus
nearby
at
the
corner
of
W.
Chicago
Ave.
and
N.
Lorel
Ave
.
He
said
he
saw
the
first
driver
attempt
to
help
the
woman
,
as
did
another
man
who
saw
her
in
the
street
,
Moore
said
.
Another
car
pulled
up
,
stopped
,
and
put
its
flashers
on
,
video
shows
.
But
what
happened
next
left
Moore
speechless
.
A
white
sedan
sped
into
the
intersection
and
plowed
right
over
the
woman
.
``
It
was
so
horrific
,
''
Moore
said
.
``
He
ran
her
over
,
it
wasn
’
t
just
like
over
her
chest
;
he
went
right
over
her
head.
”
Moore
said
he
did
n't
understand
how
the
driver
could
n't
see
the
woman
because
she
had
a
light-colored
coat
on
.
Neighbors
say
the
intersection
is
busy
,
and
they
want
the
hit-and-run
driver
to
be
punished
.
``
I
hope
they
catch
him
,
''
said
neighbor
Jamie
Sexton
.
The
50-year-old
woman
was
taken
in
critical
condition
to
Mount
Sinai
Hospital
but
died
of
her
injuries
.
Police
described
the
vehicle
as
a
white
mid-sized
sedan
,
and
said
they
have
not
made
any
arrests
.

officials

Seplak
's
defense
attorney
,
Steven

,
said
Tuesday
that
his
only
comment

that

is
next
due
in

Jan.

,
but
if
he
is
indicted
by
a
Lake
County
Grand
Jury
before
then
,
that
court
date
could
be
affected
.
According
to
information
previously
released
by
Covelli
,
investigators
learned
that
Gorski
had
seen
a
movie
at
Hawthorn
Mall
in
Vernon
Hills
with
a
30-year-
old
woman
from
Wauconda
.
The
woman
later
told
police
that
she
had
problems
with
a
stalker
,
identified
by
Covelli
as
Seplak
.
Covelli
said
officers
learned
of
at
least
one
recent
incident
in
which
Seplak
had
made
an
unwanted
appearance
at
the
woman
's
home
.
Officers
found
Seplak
at
his
house
Dec.
24
,
and
GPS
data
taken
from
his
phone
showed
he
had
traveled
to
the
Vernon
Hills
theater
and
then
to
a
house
in
the
41000
block
of
North
Route
83
in
an
unincorporated
area
near
Antioch
.
A
man
at
that
house
gave
police
a
bag
that
contained
a
handgun
and
ammunition
and
said
he
found
it
in
his
car
after
Seplak
had
visited
the
home
,
according
to
Covelli
.
Covelli
said
that
ballistic
evidence
connects
the
bullet
that
killed
Gorski
to
the
gun
found
at
the
house
and
that
gunpowder
residue
was
found
on
Seplak
.
Covelli
said
before
Seplak
's
release
that
police
are
taking
precautions
to
protect
the
woman
.
Attorney
Daniel
Hodgkinson
,
also
representing
Seplak
,
said
previously
that
Seplak
worked
for
a
beverage
distribution
company
for
about
10
years
until
recently
being
laid
off
.
``
He
's
a
very
steady
guy
who
never
missed
work
,
''
Hodgkinson
said
.
``
He
lives
with
his
parents
to
help
take
care
of
them
.

Biskup
's
attorney
,
Robert
Nemzin
,
said
he
ordered
DNA
testing
on
Biskup
's
vehicle
in
November

and
the
results
of
those
tests
were
still
pending
.
Biskup

at
the

Courthouse
in
Rolling
Meadows
.
``
This
is
a
tragedy
because
this
man
lost
his
life
,
''
Nemzin
said
.
``
She
[
Biskup
]
is
a
good
woman
who
turned
herself
in
.
''
The
State

Attorney

Office
alleges
in
the
indictment
that
Biskup
knowingly
failed
to
immediately
stop
her
vehicle
to
help
Radke
or
call
police
after

she

thought
she
hit
something

Court
documents

Biskup
to
surrender
her
Polish
passport
last

JARRATT
,
Va
.
--
A
man
convicted
of
killing
a
family
of
four
,
slashing
their
throats
and
setting
their
home
ablaze
after
they
left
their
front
door
open
while
preparing
for
a
New
Year
's
Day
party
in
2006
,
was
executed
Wednesday
.
Ricky
Gray
was
pronounced
dead
at
9:42
p.m.
following
a
lethal
injection
at
the
Greensville
Correctional
Center
in
Jarratt
.
The
39-year-old
inmate
was
put
to
death
with
the
sedative
midazolam
,
followed
by
rocuronium
bromide
to
halt
breathing
,
and
potassium
chloride
,
which
stops
the
heart
.
Gray
showed
no
emotion
as
he
was
walked
into
the
execution
chamber
wearing
blue
jeans
and
handcuffs
.
Asked
if
he
had
any
final
words
,
Gray
responded
,
``
Nope
.
''
This
undated
photo
provided
by
the
Virginia
Department
of
Corrections
shows
convicted
murderer
Ricky
Gray
who
is
scheduled
to
be
executed
Wednesday
evening
Gray
was
condemned
to
death
in
2006
for
the
murders
of
9-year-old
Stella
Harvey
and
4-year-old
sister
Ruby
,
and
sentenced
to
life
in
prison
for
the
slaying
of
their
parents
,
Bryan
and
Kathryn
Harvey
.
The
family
was
getting
ready
to
host
friends
for
a
chili
dinner
when
Gray
and
his
nephew
,
Ray
Dandridge
,
were
looking
for
a
home
to
rob
when
they
spotted
the
open
door
.
Court
records
show
they
tied
up
the
family
in
the
basement
and
Gray
slashed
their
throats
and
bashed
their
heads
with
a
hammer
before
setting
their
home
on
fire
and
fleeing
with
a
computer
,
a
wedding
ring
and
a
basket
of
cookies
.
The
well-known
family
's
slaying
rocked
Virginia
's
capital
city
and
was
followed
by
the
killing
of
another
Richmond
family
less
than
a
week
later
.
Kathryn
Harvey
was
co-owner
of
a
popular
Richmond
toy
store
,
the
World
of
Mirth
,
and
Bryan
Harvey
was
a
guitarist
and
singer
for
a
rock
duo
,
House
of
Freaks
.
Gray
also
confessed
to
participating
in
the
slaying
of
21-year-old
Ashley
Baskerville
,
her
mother
Mary
Baskerville-Tucker
and
stepfather
Percyell
Tucker
days
after
the
Harvey
deaths
,
but
was
n't
tried
in
that
case
.
Gray
and
Dandridge
said
Ashley
Baskerville
had
served
as
a
lookout
for
them
during
the
Harvey
slayings
.
Dandridge
pleaded
guilty
to
the
Tucker-Baskerville
slayings
and
is
serving
a
life
sentence
.
Elizabeth
Peiffer
,
an
attorney
for
Gray
,
said
that
while
his
death
may
provide
a
measure
of
retribution
for
some
,
it
also
took
``
from
the
world
a
man
trying
to
make
amends
and
make
life
better
for
others
.
''
Prison
officials
closed
a
blue
curtain
at
8:54
p.m.
,
shielding
Gray
from
view
.
That
is
typically
when
officials
insert
the
IV
and
place
heart
monitors
before
starting
the
injection
.
The
curtain
remained
closed
for
more
than
30
minutes
before
it
was
opened
and
the
lethal
injection
began
,
which
Pfeiffer
said
was
significantly
longer
than
usual
and
concerning
.
Lisa
Kinney
,
a
Virginia
Department
of
Corrections
spokeswoman
,
said
she
could
not
explain
why
the
curtain
was
closed
that
long
.
The
lethal
injection
began
around
9:28
p.m.
For
several
minutes
,
Gray
appeared
to
be
breathing
heavily
and
snored
loudly
several
times
.
At
9:33
p.m.
he
stopped
moving
.
Gray
was
the
first
Virginia
inmate
executed
since
convicted
serial
killer
Alfredo
Prieto
received
a
lethal
injection
in
October
2015
.
Just
six
inmates
remain
on
Virginia
's
death
row
.
No
other
execution
dates
have
been
set
.
Virginia
obtained
the
midazolam
and
potassium
chloride
from
a
compounding
pharmacy
whose
identity
is
secret
under
a
new
state
law
.
Midazolam
has
come
under
fire
after
several
problematic
executions
in
other
states
,
with
critics
arguing
it
causes
inmates
to
suffer
a
painful
death
because
it
can
not
reliably
render
them
unconscious
.
Gray
's
attorneys
had
said
the
fact
that
the
drug
was
obtained
from
a
compounding
pharmacy
rather
than
a
typical
manufacturer
magnifies
the
risk
of
problems
.
But
the
U.S.
Supreme
Court
narrowly
upheld
the
use
of
midazolam
in
2015
and
the
high
court
earlier
Wednesday
rejected
Gray
's
bid
to
stay
the
execution
so
he
could
challenge
the
planned
use
of
the
compounded
version
of
the
drug
.
Gray
's
attorneys
had
unsuccessfully
appealed
to
Virginia
Gov
.
Terry
McAuliffe
to
spare
his
life
,
saying
Gray
's
actions
arose
from
drug
use
aimed
at
numbing
years
of
sexual
abuse
by
his
older
brother
when
he
was
a
child
.
Gray
says
he
was
high
on
PCP
at
the
time
of
the
Harvey
slayings
and
does
n't
remember
much
.
Several
death
penalty
opponents
and
some
relatives
of
Gray
held
a
vigil
outside
the
prison
as
he
was
executed
,
the
Richmond
Times-Dispatch
reported
.
After
Gray
's
arrest
for
the
Harvey
family
murders
,
he
also
confessed
to
killing
his
wife
,
Treva
Gray
.
With
the
help
of
Dandridge
he
bludgeoned
her
to
death
with
a
lead
pipe
in
November
2005
,
according
to
the
court
documents
.
Gray
was
questioned
at
the
time
but
was
not
arrested
for
her
murder
.

A
[
Chicago
Public
Schools
]
[

]
dean
sexually
assaulted
a
14-year-old
student
repeatedly
at
her
South
Side
school
starting
last
spring
after
she
was
sent
to
his
office
for
disciplinary
problems
,
Cook
County
prosecutors
alleged
Tuesday
.
Stanley
Carothers
III
,
29
,
was
the
dean
of
operations
at
Brad
well
School
of
Excellence
,
a
South
Shore
turnaround
school
managed
by
the
Academy
for
Urban
School
Leadership
,
prosecutors
said
.
Assista
nt
State
's
Attorney
Jullian
Brevard
said
the
abuse
started
after
the
eighth-grader
was
sent
to
Carothers
'
office
in
March
for
``
disciplinary
matters
.
''
The
dean
took
the
girl
to
another
room
and
sexually
assaulted
her
,
Brevard
said
.
Carothers
had
sex
with
the
girl
at
the
school
or
his
apartment
over
the
next
eight
months
,
even
over
the
summer
months
,
Brevard
said
.
In
bond
court
,
Carothers
'
attorney
,
Frank
Kostouros
,
denied
the
allegations
,
showing
Judge
Peggy
Chiampas
a
printout
of
a
Facebook
message
in
which
the
girl
allegedly
recanted
and
apologized
for
the
``
setup
type
situation
.
''
``
The
victim
admits
she
's
lying
and
apologizes
,
''
Kostouros
told
the
judge
.
Chiampas
ordered
Carothers
released
on
a
personal
recognizance
bond
with
electronic
monitoring
.
Carothers
left
Bradwell
in
November
for
another
CPS
school
and
is
on
unpaid
leave
,
Kostouros
said
.
A
CPS
spokesman
said
in
a
statement
the
district
responded
to
``
serious
allegations
''
in
November
by
removing
an
employee
from
the
Dulles
School
of
Excellence
.
The
district
did
not
name
Carothers
but
said
the
employee
had
been
suspended
indefinitely
without
pay
.
Prosecutors
said
the
girl
first
told
a
classmate
about
the
abuse
last
spring
,
but
police
were
n't
notified
until
the
girl
told
a
family
member
in
November
.
The
relative
contacted
Chicago
police
.
Prosecutors
said
the
girl
gave
a
handwritten
statement
to
police
and
later
that
same
day
identified
Carothers
'
apartment
.
A
day
after
making
the
statement
,
the
girl
had
sex
again
with
Carothers
,
prosecutors
said
.
Authorities
later
took
a
second
handwritten
statement
from
the
girl
.
Carothers
denied
allowing
any
students
into
his
home
,
prosecutors
said
.
Carothers
and
the
girl
began
talking
over
Facebook
Messenger
in
March
,
prosecutors
said
,
but
the
dean
soon
asked
the
girl
to
stop
texting
him
to
the
account
under
his
given
name
and
to
instead
message
him
at
a
profile
he
controlled
under
another
name
,
prosecutors
said
.
The
two
exchanged
sexual
messages
,
discussing
times
and
places
to
meet
for
sex
and
referring
to
prior
sexual
contact
between
them
,
prosecutors
said
.
Carothers
left
Bradwell
in
November
for
another
CPS
school
and
is
on
unpaid
leave
,
Kostouros
said
.
The
attorney
said
in
court
the
girl
may
have
retaliated
after
Carothers
ordered
an
emergency
mental
health
evaluation
for
her
and
she
was
hospitalized
.
The
teen
,
who
Kostouros
said
has
a
history
of
``
uncontrollable
''
classroom
behavior
,
later
sent
a
Facebook
message
apologizing
,
he
said
.
``
Hey
mr
carruthers
.
I
sorry
that
I
lyed
on
u
saying
we
did
stuff
,
''
said
the
message
,
a
copy
of
which
Kostouros
filed
as
an
exhibit
.
``
I
didt
no
they
was
taken
it
this
far
.
They
dared
me
to
do
this

A
west
suburban
Villa
Park
woman
is
charged
with
stealing
nearly
$
250,000
from
her
uncle
,
who
was
diagnosed
with
dementia
.
Sharon
Cermak
,
60
,
of
the
1
S300
block
of
Buttercup
,
was
charged
with
a
felony
count
of
financial
exploitation
of
a
person
over
80
,
according
to
court
records
from
the
DuPage
County
sheriff
’
s
office
.
Her
bond
was
set
at
$
100,000
on
Wednesday
.
Cermak
began
stealing
from
her
uncle
in
June
2013
,
and
used
her
power
of
attorney
to
withdraw
money
from
his
bank
account
,
write
checks
to
herself
and
others
,
and
use
her
uncle
’
s
debit
card
until
November
2015
,
the
DuPage
County
state
’
s
attorney
’
s
office
said
.
The
total
amount
stolen
was
nearly
$
250,000
.
The
alleged
thefts
were
discovered
by
officials
with
DuPage
County
Adult
Protectives
Services
,
who
brought
the
accusations
to
the
attention
of
the
state
’
s
attorney
’
s
office
.
Cermak
’
s
uncle
has
since
passed
away
,
prosecutors
said
.

Chicago
is
making
scant
progress
in
its
ongoing
battle
against
rampant
youth
joblessness
,
new
statistics
show
,
though
there
is
a
modicum
of
good
news
.
The
share
of
20-
to
24-year-old
black
men
who
were
neither
working
nor
in
school
declined
modestly
between
2014
and
2015
,
from
a
dismal
47
percent
to
a
still-dismal
43
percent
,
according
to
a
report
set
to
be
presented
Monday
at
the
Chicago
Urban
League
's
annual
forum
on
the
youth
unemployment
crisis
.
But
even
more
sobering
are
long-term
data
showing
how
Chicago
came
to
be
a
national
leader
in
joblessness
among
young
people
,
particularly
young
black
people
living
in
the
highly
segregated
neighborhoods
wracked
by
violence
.
The
steep
decline
of
well-paying
manufacturing
jobs
,
the
rise
of
low-paying
retail
jobs
and
the
``
emptying
out
of
jobs
''
from
the
neighborhoods
as
commerce
centralized
downtown
changed
the
economic
structure
of
the
city
to
the
detriment
of
black
and
,
to
a
lesser
extent
,
Latino
youth
,
the
study
found
.
Teresa
Cordova
,
director
of
the
Great
Cities
Institute
at
the
[
University
of
Illinois
at
Chicago
]
[
1
]
and
co-author
of
the
report
,
said
it
's
easy
to
blame
individual
weaknesses
for
employment
struggles
,
but
the
trends
suggest
a
far
more
complex
challenge
that
demands
a
comprehensive
response
.
``
The
solutions
have
to
address
some
of
these
structural
dynamics
,
''
Cordova
said
.
``
More
than
ever
it
makes
the
case
about
why
this
is
everybody
's
problem
.
''
The
forum
,
in
its
sixth
year
,
comes
as
Chicago
draws
national
headlines
—
and
President
[
Donald
Trump
]
[
2
]
's
attention
—
for
soaring
violence
that
wo
n't
seem
to
quit
.
Chicago
experienced
its
worst
violence
in
two
decades
last
year
,
with
more
than
4,300
people
shot
and
762
killed
,
according
to
Police
Department
statistics
.
The
violence
has
continued
at
comparable
levels
so
far
in
January
.
Trump
tweeted
on
Tuesday
that
he
would
``
send
in
the
Feds
!
''
if
Chicago
does
n't
fix
the
``
carnage
,
''
though
it
was
n't
clear
if
he
meant
troops
or
another
kind
of
intervention
.
Cordova
had
a
suggestion
.
``
If
he
wants
to
involve
the
federal
government
in
helping
to
address
our
problem
of
violence
,
then
send
us
federal
dollars
for
summer
employment
,
jobs
programs
and
dollars
to
revitalize
our
neighborhoods

Chicago
Tribune
)
Joblessness
is
among
multiple
factors
contributing
to
Chicago
's
violence
,
the
report
said
.
Of
the
city
's
77
community
areas
,
just
five
accounted
for
a
third
of
the
homicides
last
year
,
and
those
same
five
had
jobless
rates
ranging
from
79
to
92
percent
for
teens
and
49
to
70
percent
for
young
adults
.
Joblessness
,
which
in
this
context
describes
anyone
who
is
not
working
,
is
not
the
same
as
unemployment
,
which
describes
those
who
are
not
working
but
are
actively
looking
for
work
.
Youth
have
said
at
past
forums
that
jobs
offer
income
and
exposure
to
opportunities
that
demonstrate
an
alternative
to
the
illegal
activities
happening
outside
their
doorsteps
.
They
also
have
said
jobs
are
difficult
to
land
.
Darron
Gunnings
,
18
,
who
is
one
of
six
young
people
scheduled
to
speak
at
Monday
's
forum
,
feels
lucky
that
his
mom
was
on
him
to
study
and
find
a
summer
job
,
because
many
of
his
peers
do
n't
have
that
influence
.
``
They
do
n't
come
from
that
kind
of
family
,
''
said
Gunnings
,
who
worked
summers
as
a
youth
leader
in
agriculture
at
UCan
,
a
social
services
organization
in
North
Lawndale
where
his
mom
works
.
Gunnings
,
who
lives
in
the
Altgeld
Gardens
public
housing
project
on
the
city
's
southern
edge
,
had
his
own
struggles
.
He
got
into
fights
,
and
was
placed
on
24-hour
house
arrest
for
a
summer
after
a
gun
was
found
in
his
backpack
at
school
.
He
said
he
had
taken
it
off
of
a
friend
who
brought
it
to
ward
off
bullies
who
tried
to
rob
students

who

to
graduate
from

Christian

this
June
,
speaks
eagerly

landscapes
of
Ireland
,
the
cherry
blossoms
in
Japan
and
the
Hawaiian
reefs
.
Jack
Wuest
,
executive
director
of
the
Alternative
Schools
Network
,
which
commissioned
the
Great
Cities
report
,
worries
not
enough
kids
are
having
that
experience
.
A
lack
of
federal
funding
for
summer
jobs
has
left
kids
without
early
work
experience
and
the
elemental
skills
,
such
as
how
to
take
direction
or
show
up
on
time
,
that
make
them
good
employees
,
he
said
.
``
There
has
just
been
this
huge
gap
,
and
I
think
it
's
going
to
affect
the
economy
because
of
the
labor
shortages
businesses
already
are
talking
about
,
''
Wuest
said
.
Chicago
's
problems
with
youth
unemployment
have
stood
out
because
of
severe
racial
disparities
that
are
starker
than
in
cities
like
New
York
City
and
Los
Angeles
,
especially
among
20-
to
24-year-olds
.
On
most
measures
,
blacks
do
far
worse
and
whites
do
significantly
better
in
Chicago
than
in
those
cities
and
compared
with
national
averages
.
Chicago
's
Latino
youth
employment
rate
,
meanwhile
,
largely
mirrors
the
nation
's
.
Take
the
statistics
on
early
20-somethings
who
were
both
out
of
school
and
out
of
work
,
a
population
that
worries
policymakers
.
In
Chicago
in
2015
,
40
percent
of
young
blacks
fell
into
that
category
,
compared
with
7
percent
of
whites
and
21
percent
of
Hispanics
,
according
to
Great
Cities
.
Nationally
,
the
rate
was
25
percent
of
young
blacks
,
13
percent
of
whites
and
19
percent
of
Hispanics
.
The
racial
disparities
were
not
so
great
among
16-
to
19-year-olds
who
were
not
working
or
in
school
.
Thirteen
percent
of
black
Chicago
teens
and
6.3
percent
of
white
Chicago
teens
fell
into
that
category
,
both
a
notch
above
the
national
averages
,
and
8
percent
of
Hispanic
teens
,
a
notch
below
.
It
is
n't
clear
why
the
racial
gap
widens
so
drastically
after
the
teen
years
.
But
it
appears
that
it
has
gotten
worse
over
the
decades
.
The
economic
forces
driving
some
of
those
trends
can
be
traced
to
Chicago
's
heavy
reliance
on
manufacturing
jobs
and
their
steep
decline
,
according
to
the
Great
Cities
report
.
The
city
's
youth
were
more
likely
than
youth
nationally
to
work
in
manufacturing
,
so
the
industry
's
fall
hit
them
harder
,
particularly
Hispanics
.
The
jobs
that
filled
the
void
tell
the
other
part
of
the
story
.
By
2015
,
nearly
half
of
employed
black
20-
to
24-year-olds
and
40
percent
of
Hispanics
in
that
age
group
were
working
in
retail
,
compared
with
30
percent
of
whites
.
Whites
were
more
likely
to
work
in
professional
and
related
services
jobs
,
a
diverse
category
that
includes
hospitals
and
legal
services
.
Those
differences
were
felt
in
people
's
paychecks
.
More
than
70
percent
of
retail
jobs
held
by
early
20-somethings
in
2015
paid
less
than
$
20,000
.
That
compares
with
61
percent
of
professional
and
related
services
jobs
in
2015
and
just
36
percent
of
manufacturing
jobs
in
1960
.
The
earnings
of
youth
have
greatly
suffered
with
the
industry
shifts
,
the
report
said
.
No
longer
can
an
early
job
pay
for
a
home
,
bills
or
college
tuition
.
At
the
same
time
,
jobs
left
the
neighborhoods
,
which
leads
to
population
and
business
flight
that
compounds
community
hardships
,
according
to
Great
Cities
,
which
crunched
data
from
the
Illinois
Department
of
Employment
Security
.
Manufacturing
jobs
,
which
in
1970
were
present
in
all
Chicago
ZIP
codes
,
are
nearly
wiped
off
the
map
in
2015
.
Retail
jobs
,
which
in
1970
had
big
hubs
in
certain
South
and
West
side
neighborhoods
,
by
2015
were
concentrated
downtown
and
on
the
North
Side
.

To
be
sure
,
youth
of
all
races
have
struggled
with
employment
,
particularly
teens
,
who
have
seen
employment
rates
plunge
over
the
past
15
years
.
The
employment
rates
among
white
and
black
teens
have
recovered
some
since
the
recession
but
have
not
returned
to
pre-recession
levels
,
while
rates
for
Latino
teens
have
continued
to
fall
even
during
the
economic
recovery
.
But
black
youth
in
Chicago
are
consistently
at
the
back
of
the
hiring
line
.
Among
20-
to
24-year-olds
,
only
blacks
had
lower
employment
rates
in
2015
than
they
did
in
1960
.
Among
the
broad
recommendations
in
the
report
are
to
revive
economically
abandoned
neighborhoods
,
prepare
young
people
from
those
neighborhoods
for
available
jobs
,
reduce
employment
barriers
for
youth
with
criminal
records
and
create
new
opportunities
,
such
as
apprenticeships
.
Wuest
says
he
hopes
Trump
will
consider
these
youth
if
he
moves
forward
with
a
big
infrastructure
project
.
The
issue
is
getting
some
resources
,
including
$
36
million
that
the
city
will
invest
in
mentorship
programs
.
Cook
County
Board
President
Toni
Preckwinkle
,
who
will
join
Sen.
Dick
Durbin
,
D-Ill.
,
and
two
dozen
other
public
officials
at
the
forum
,
said
the
county
since
2013
has
put
$
11.5
million
toward
addressing
community
dysfunction
on
the
front
end
,
before
youth
get
into
the
criminal
justice
system
.
Most
of
that
is
for
violence
prevention
,
anti-recidivism
and
restorative
justice
,
but
$
1
million
of
it
is
for
a
pilot
employment
program
,
expected
to
start
in
June
,
to
help
200
``
opportunity
youth
''
(
16-
to
24-
year-olds
who
are
not
working
or
in
school
or
at
risk
of
getting
involved
in
the
justice
system
)
in
select
communities
get
training
.
Still
,
Shari
Runner
,
president
and
CEO
of
the
Chicago
Urban
League
,
feels
frustrated
by
the
lack
of
progress
.
Though
last
year
's
widely-read
Great
Cities
report
highlighting
the
racial
disparities
drew
outrage
,
``
there
was
n't
much
movement
''
taken
to
combat
it
in
the
aftermath
,
Runner
said
.
In
part
that
's
because
the
state
's
budget
standoff
is
not
encouraging
businesses
to
invest
in
neighborhoods
that
need
an
infusion
,
but
there
are
also
deep-seated
challenges
with
schools
not
preparing
students
for
jobs
that
are
available
,
she
said
.
The
next
step
,
she
said
,
is
for
the
business
community
to
invest
in
the
city
youth
who
need
it
most
,
training
those
who
are
out
of
school
already
as
well
as
kids
who
are
in
school
now
.
Danny
Friedman
,
vice
president
and
co-owner
of
Food
and
Paper
Supply
Co.
in
the
Grand
Crossing
neighborhood
on
the
South
Side
,
said
businesses
will
be
better
for
it
.
Friedman
,
one
of
two
business
owners
scheduled
to
speak
at
the
forum
,
hires
youth
from
the
community
as
well
as
from
a
job
prep
program
for
kids
who
are
wards
of
the
state
.
Many
are
long-term
employees
and
two
are
now
managers
.
The
interview
process
is
eye-opening
,
he
said
.
Some
kids
come
in
a
suit
and
tie
;
others
are
far
underdressed
.
But
he
looks
past
initial
perceptions
to
see
if
they
have
the
right
personality
and
ability
to
lift
things
.
The
company
,
founded
in
1976
,
delivers
paper
and
food
products
to
restaurants
and
operates
a
wholesale
store
.
Friedman
said
he
would
hire
more
youth
if
the
government
would
subsidize
an
internship
program
,
reducing
his
risk
.
There
are
sometimes
challenges
,
such
as
having
to
re-emphasize
the
dress
code
,
but
he
says
that
's
true
for
most
teens
without
job
experience
.
``
These
are
kids
who
are
ready
to
learn
and
our
government
should
be
involved
for
a
greater
self-interest
,
''
he
said
.
``
A
good
citizen
is
not
a
burden
on
society
,
but
is
a
benefit
.

A
24-year-old
man
was
shot
Saturday
afternoon
in
the
South
Shore
neighborhood
on
the
South
Side
.
He
was
driving
at
2:41
p.m.
in
the
2800
block
of
East
76th
Street
when
someone
in
another
vehicle
pulled
up
and
fired
several
shots
,
according
to
Chicago
Police
.
The
man
then
crashed
his
vehicle
into
a
parked
car
.
He
suffered
a
gunshot
wound
to
the
back
and
was
taken
to
Northwestern
Memorial
Hospital
,
where
his
condition
was
stabilized
,
police
said
.

Growing
up
in
Hyde
Park
and
attending
De
La
Salle
Institute
limited
Bryant
Gumbel
's
exposure
to
the
danger
he
now
finds
so
difficult
to
comprehend
in
his
hometown
.
``
Hyde
Park
was
a
rare
island
in
the
sea
of
Chicago
,
integrated
in
a
segregated
city
,
well-educated
in
a
blue-collar
town
,
populated
by
a
ton
of
immigrants
,
the
kind
of
neighborhood
someone
once
said
after
dinner
instead
of
watching
'I
Love
Lucy
,
'
you
read
Socrates
,
''
said
Gumbel
,
68
,
one
of
sports
'
most
intellectual
voices
.
``
I
do
n't
know
if
I
'd
go
that
far
,
but
everybody
read
,
got
along
and
took
pride
in
who
they
were
,
a
real
melting
pot
.
Once
you
left
the
neighborhood
,
you
saw
how
the
rest
of
the
world
is
.
…
But
it
seems
that
's
changed
,
too
,
there
.
''
Concerns
over
Chicago
's
violence
compelled
Gumbel
to
return
with
a
crew
from
his
HBO
show
,
``
Real
Sports
,
''
and
explore
,
among
other
things
,
a
rise
in
shooting
deaths
coinciding
with
the
decline
of
what
is
known
on
the
streets
as
``
The
Hooper
's
Pass
.
''
A
Hooper
's
Pass
used
to
exclude
gifted
basketball
players
from
the
gang
violence
that
victimized
so
many
other
teens
,
and
Gumbel
focused
on
recent
tragedies
at
Marshall
High
to
illustrate
how
things
have
changed
.
He
interviewed
Arthur
Agee
,
one
of
the
stars
of
the
1994
documentary
``
Hoop
Dreams
,
''
and
Agee
's
former
Marshall
teammate
Shawn
Harrington
,
paralyzed
in
a
2014
shooting
in
Humboldt
Park
while
driving
his
daughter
to
school
.
Gumbel
's
HBO
piece
last
week
,
still
available
on
demand
,
touched
on
the
deaths
of
former
Marshall
basketball
players
Tim
Triplett
in
2015
and
twins
Edward
and
Edwin
Bryant
last
October
.
``
Any
awareness
about
an
epidemic
that
's
taking
away
lives
is
helpful
,
''
said
Agee
,
planning
a
speaking
tour
with
``
Hoops
Dreams
''
co-star
William
Gates
in
March
.
``
I
hope
a
lot
of
gangbangers
,
the
guys
doing
the
shooting
,
saw
the
HBO
story
and
thought
about
what
they
're
doing
.
…
Mr.
Gumbel
was
honest
,
upfront
.
''
Gumbel
displayed
the
same
candor
discussing
his
``
passion
project
''
with
the
Tribune
.
**
What
brought
you
here
?
**
Gumbel
(
who
credited
HBO
producer
Maggie
Burbank
with
the
idea
)
:
The
best
thing
TV
can
do
is
have
somebody
say
I
did
n't
know
that
.
We
all
tend
to
think
too
routinely
about
things
that
are
negative
these
days
,
like
,
'Oh
,
yeah
,
six
people
were
killed
last
night
.
'
Until
you
can
put
a
face
to
it
,
it
really
does
n't
touch
you
.
In
this
case
,
I
do
n't
know
how
to
make
any
sense
of
the
numbers
in
Chicago
.
I
grew
up
there
and
it
was
never
a
Pollyanna
city
,
but
this
is
mind-numbing
.
Stunning
.
Frightening
.
**
Did
you
sense
more
hope
or
helplessness
?
**
Helplessness
.
I
wish
I
could
say
hope
.
I
really
do
.
I
have
to
be
careful
here
.
…
It
has
gone
so
far
that
it
makes
you
wonder
about
the
will
of
people
to
stop
it
.
The
problem
is
so
intense
you
ca
n't
just
throw
up
your
hands
and
say
there
's
nothing
we
can
do
.
There
is
always
something
that
can
be
done
.
It
depends
how
you
want
to
prioritize
it
and
how
important
it
is
.
The
evidence
would
suggest
that
it
's
not
as
high
as
it
could
or
should
be
,
but
I
'm
not
there
on
a
daily
basis
and
I
do
n't
want
to
insult
anybody
by
suggesting
they
're
not
trying

I
do

any

what
would

of
them
,
maybe
because
I
grew
up
with
a
heightened
awareness
.
All
that
said
,
I
did
have
it
voiced
to
me
while
I
was
there
:
We
're
going
to
have
to
be
careful
.
I
thought
that
was
strange
.
I
had
never
heard
that
before
when
I
was
in
Chicago
,
and
I
've
been
in
all
parts
,
and
never
once
worried
about
my
safety
.
I
guess
I
was
n't
worried
this
time
,
but
it
was
voiced
to
me
.
**
Do
you
believe
sports
success
**
**
can
play
a
role
in
unifying
cities
or
dim
inishing
violence
?
**
I
'd
like
to
believe
that
,
but
I
guess
,
even
if
I
do
,
whatever
good
it
does
seems
to
be
temporary
.
When
you
and
the
guy
sitting
behind
you
both
like
a
home
run
,
you
high-five
.
But
when
you
both
go
home
,
does
that
guy
still
feel
the
same
way
about
people
that
look
like
you
or
believe
what
you
believe
?
Or
even
give
you
a
thought
?
I
suspect
not
,
but
I
am
kind
of
ashamed
to
say
that
.
I
wish
it
were
otherwise
.
**
You
used
the
word
``
numbing
''
to
describe
the
effect
of
violence
.
How
?
**
After
a
while
,
it
betrays
the
very
definition
of
news
,
something
that
is
different
.
News
is
,
``
Plane
crashes
,
''
not
,
``
Plane
lands
.
''
If
we
have
murders
every
day
,
people
become
immune
to
it
.
It
's
truly
stunning
to
me
.
We
're
talking
about
a
level
of
violence
you
or
I
ca
n't
comprehend
.
Then
you
wonder
why
kids
,
not
only
in
Chicago
,
perform
so
poorly
academically
.
Well
,
when
your
preoccupation
is
trying
to
stay
alive
and
not
get
shot
on
the
street
on
the
way
to
and
from
school
,
it
's
very
difficult
to
prioritize
studying
for
a
history
exam
.

,
stiffing
a
Wicker

tattoo
she
gave
DeBoer
on

and
not
paying

to
pay
for

A
14-year-old
boy
from
[
Park
Ridge
]
[
1
]
is
facing
a
hate
crime
charge
after
police
say
he
was
identified
among
a
group
of
teens
who
allegedly
used
racial
slurs
toward
a
local
store
employee
.
The
alleged
incident
occurred
Saturday
afternoon
at
a
store
in
the
Summit
of
Park
Ridge
shopping
center
.
According
to
the
police
report
,
a
63-year-old
man
working
in
the
store
told
officers
that
a
group
of
teens
entered
the
business
and
``
began
harassing
him
,
calling
him
names
regarding
his
ethnicity
and
using
racial
slurs
along
with
profanity
,
''
said
Park
Ridge
Deputy
Police
Chief
Lou
Jogmen
.
The
man
ordered
the
teens
out
of
the
store
,
and
when
he
began
calling
police
,
they
left
,
but
some
reportedly
began
throwing
dirt
and
rocks
at
the
store
window
,
Jogmen
said
.
When
police
arrived
,
the
teens
ran
off
,
but
officers
later
located
a
group
matching
their
descriptions
at
Hinkley
Park
,
25
Busse
Highway
,
Jogmen
said
.
The
14-year-old
was
charged
with
a
hate
crime
,
disorderly
conduct
and
criminal
trespass
in
connection
with
the
earlier
incident
,
police
said
.
An
employee
of
the
store
told
the
Park
Ridge
Herald-Advocate
that
over
the
last
few
months
,
he
has
had
problems
with
large
groups
of
teens
—
including
the
ones
present
on
Saturday
—
congregating
inside
and
outside
his
store
,
buying
very
little
or
nothing
at
all
,
and
using
profanity
.
He
said
he
has
had
to
tell
kids
they
ca
n't
be
in
the
store
unless
they
are
there
to
buy
something
and
that
only
two
or
three
will
be
allowed
inside
at
one
time
.
The
employee
,
who
requested
anonymity
because
he
said
he
was
concerned
about
retribution
,
said
he
let
previous
incidents
go
,
but
this

WASHINGTON
--
The
Homeland
Security
Department
said
Monday
that
680
people
were
arrested
in
roundups
last
week
[
targeting
immigrants
living
illegally
in
the
United
States
]
[
1
]
.
The
figure
is
far
below
the
totals
of
similar
raids
conducted
under
the
Obama
administration
.
The
raids
have
left
immigrant
communities
worried
about
stepped-up
enforcement
efforts
and
the
White
House
taking
credit
for
arrests
.
But
Homeland
Security
described
the
roundups
as
routine
.
DHS
Secretary
John
Kelly
said
Immigration
and
Customs
Enforcement
targeted
immigrants
who
are
a
threat
to
public
safety
,
including
convicted
criminals
and
gang
members
.
He
said
75
percent
of
those
arrested
were
criminals
,
some
of
whom
had
been
convicted
of
homicide
and
aggravated
sexual
assault
.
ICE
officials
said
161
people
from
13
countries
were
arrested
in
the
Los
Angeles
area
,
all
but
10
of
whom
were
convicted
criminals
.
More
than
100
people
arrested
there
were
from
Mexico
.
Kelly
said
arrests
were
also
made
by
agents
working
in
New
York
,
Atlanta
,
Chicago
and
San
Antonio
.
Details
of
who
was
arrested
were
not
made
available
,
but
the
arrests
and
rumors
about
other
raids
sparked
fear
and
confusion
among
immigrants
.
Immigration
advocates
and
the
White
House
both
suggested
the
arrests
were
President
Donald
Trump
's
first
salvo
in
what
he
has
promised
will
be
a
stepped
up
campaign
to
find
and
deport
criminal
immigrants
and
others
living
in
the
U.S.
illegally
.
Trump
on
Monday
bragged
that
his
administration
was
following
through
on
his
campaign
pledge
and
targeting
``
the
bad
ones
.
''
``
I
said
at
the
beginning
we
are
going
to
get
the
bad
ones
,
the
really
bad
ones
,
we
are
going
to
get
them
out
,
''
Trump
said
at
a
news
conference
with
Canadian
Prime
Minister
Justin
Trudeau
.
ICE
officials
and
Kelly
,
however
,
have
said
the
arrests
were
part
of
routine
enforcement
efforts
.
Similar
roundups
under
former
President
Barack
Obama
yielded
far
more
arrests
.
In
March
2015
,
ICE
said
a
five-day
enforcement
effort
ended
with
more
than
2,000
arrests
.
During
the
Obama
administration
,
however
,
ICE
agents
generally
arrested
wanted
immigration
fugitives
and
convicted
criminals
.
Last
week
's
arrests
included
immigrants
whose
only
offense
was
an
immigration
violation
.
**
Fact
check
:
Are
immigration
raids
result
of
Trump
policy
?
**
TRUMP
VS.
OBAMA
As
a
candidate
,
Donald
Trump
vowed
to
take
a
hard
line
on
immigration
.
Five
days
after
taking
office
,
he
signed
a
sweeping
executive
order
that
made
clear
that
just
about
any
immigrant
living
in
the
country
illegally
could
be
a
priority
for
deportation
,
particularly
those
with
outstanding
deportation
orders
.
The
president
's
order
also
said
enforcement
priorities
would
include
convicted
criminals
,
immigrants
who
had
been
arrested
for
any
criminal
offense
,
those
who
committed
fraud
and
anyone
who
may
have
committed
a
crime
,
including
immigration
violations
.
Under
President
Barack
Obama
,
the
government
focused
on
immigrants
in
the
country
illegally
who
posed
a
threat
to
national
security
or
public
safety
and
recent
border
crossers
.
But
despite
the
narrower
focus
,
more
than
2
million
people
were
deported
during
Obama
's
time
in
office
,
including
a
record
of
more
than
409,000
people
in
2012
.
At
one
point
,
his
critics
dubbed
him
the
``
deporter
in
chief
.
''
The
record
was
reached
with
the
help
of
the
Secure
Communities
program
that
helped
the
government
identify
immigrants
in
the
United
States
illegally
who
had
been
arrested
.
In
the
latter
half
of
Obama
's
tenure
the
Secure
Communities
program
fell
out
of
favor
with
the
administration
and
local
jurisdictions
,
and
deportations
plummeted
to
lows
matching
those
during
former
President
George
W.
Bush
's
term
.
ARE
THE
LATEST
RAIDS
A
DIRECT
RESULT
OF
TRUMP
'S
ORDER
?
Immigration
officials
said
they
were
n't
.
But
Trump
,
during
a
press
conference
Monday
with
Canadian
Prime
Minister
Justin
Trudeau
,
bragged
that
his
administration
was
following
through
on
his
campaign
pledge
and
targeting
``
the
bad
ones
.
''
He
said
immigration
authorities
focused
on
immigrants
in
the
country
illegally
``
with
a
tremendous
track
record
of
abuse
and
problems
and
we
are
getting
them
out
.
''
``
I
said
at
the
beginning
we
are
going
to
get
the
bad
ones
,
the
really
bad
ones
,
we
are
going
to
get
them
out
,
''
Trump
said
.
David
Marin
,
Immigration
and
Customs
Enforcement
's
field
office
director
for
enforcement
and
removal
operations
in
greater
Los
Angeles
,
said
the
agency
carries
out
these
operations
two
or
three
times
a
year
in
his
region
.
The
California
operation
was
in
the
planning
stages
``
before
the
administration
came
out
with
their
current
executive
orders
,
''
he
said
.
But
immigrant
rights
groups
say
the
actions
are
harsher
than
in
the
past
.
Advocates
began
fielding
calls
Thursday
from
immigrants
and
their
lawyers
reporting
raids
at
homes
and
businesses
in
the
greater
Los
Angeles
area
.
In
one
instance
,
agents
showed
up
at
the
home
of
a
50-year-old
house
painter
named
Manuel
Mosqueda
in
the
Los
Angeles
suburbs
,
looking
to
arrest
an
immigrant
who
was
n't
there
.
In
the
process
,
they
spoke
with
Mosqueda
,
arrested
him
and
put
him
on
a
bus
to
Mexico
-
though
lawyers
were
able
to
halt
his
deportation
and
bring
him
back
.
In
all
,
Immigration
and
Customs
Enforcement
arrested
680
immigrants
.
Homeland
Security
Secretary
John
Kelly
said
everyone
arrested
posed
``
a
threat
to
public
safety
,
border
security
or
the
integrity
of
our
nation
's
immigration
system
.
''
Kelly
said
about
75
percent
of
the
people
arrested
were
criminals
convicted
of
a
variety
of
crimes
,
including
``
homicide
,
aggravated
sexual
abuse
,
sexual
assault
of
a
minor
,
lewd
and
lascivious
acts
with
a
child
,
indecent
liberties
with
a
minor
,
drug
trafficking
,
battery
,
assault
,
DUI
and
weapons
charges
.
''
ICE
had
previously
called
the
arrests
an
``
enforcement
surge
''
that
was
no
different
than
enforcement
actions
carried
out
in
the
past
and
said
a
``
rash
of
recent
reports
about
purported
ICE
checkpoints
and
random
sweeps
are
false
,
dangerous
and
irresponsible
.
''
In
a
statement
,
the
agency
said
``
officers
frequently
encounter
additional
suspects
who
may
be
in
the
United
States
in
violation
of
the
federal
immigration
laws
.
Those
persons
will
be
evaluated
on
a
case-by-case
basis
and
,
when
appropriate
,
arrested
by
ICE
.
''
THE
NEW
NORMAL
?
Despite
the
claims
that
this
is
business
as
usual
,
an
indication
of
the
changed
tactics
came
earlier
in
the
week
when
Kelly
testified
before
Congress
.
He
told
lawmakers
that
immigration
agents
expressed
frustration
at
not
being
fully
allowed
to
enforce
immigration
laws
under
the
Obama
administration
.
He
predicted
Trump
's
directives
would
end
that
frustration
.
``
I
think
their
morale
has
suffered
because
of
the
job
they
were
hired
to
do
,
and
then
in
their
sense
,
they
're
...
kind
of
hobbled
or
,
you
know
,
hands
tied
behind
their
back
,
that
kind
of
thing
,
''
Kelly
told
the
House
Homeland
Security
Committee
.
``
And
now
,
they
feel
more
positive
about
things
.
I
bet
if
you
watch
the
morale
issue
,
you
'll
...
be
surprised
going
forward
.
''
Acting
ICE
Director
Thomas
Homan
,
who
was
previously
in
charge
of
the
agency
's
enforcement
and
removal
operations
,
earlier
this
month
made
a
point
of
noting
that
his
agents
would
enforce
the
law
.
In
at
least
one
case
,
it
seems
clear
that
Trump
's
order
changed
someone
's
fate
.
Guadalupe
Garcia
de
Rayos
,
a
mother
of
two
in
Phoenix
,
was
arrested
nearly
a
decade
ago
for
using
a
false
ID
to
get
a
job
as
a
janitor
at
an
amusement
park
.
She
pleaded
guilty
to
a
felony
charge
,
but
the
government
during
the
Obama
years
declined
to
deport
her
despite
her
being
in
the
country
illegally
and
a
judge
's
order
that
she
leave
.
On
Wednesday
,
she
showed
up
at
the
ICE
building
in
Phoenix
for
a
scheduled
check-in
with
immigration
officers
and
was
swiftly
deported
to
Mexico
.

The
impact
from
the
SUV
caused
the
taxi
cab
to
slam
directly
into
one
of
the
trees
that
lined
the
residential
street
.
Maywood
police
said
the
driver
of
the
SUV
,
a
24-year-old
woman
,
then
took
off
on
foot
before
she
was
eventually
captured
by
authorities
and
arrested
.
Charges
are
pending
against
her
,
police
said
.
Rescue
workers
and
family
members
,
including
their
brother
Ernest
Shelton
,
said
they
did
all
they
could
to
save
the
siblings
’
lives
.
“
When
she
was
in
the
cab
,
she
was
crying
,
I
heard
her
crying
,
”
Ernest
Shelton
said
of
his
sister
.
“
I
could
n't
open
the
door
.
It
was
stuck
together
.
''
Detectives
said
all
factors
,
including
drugs
and
alcohol
,
are
still
possibilities
as
to
the
cause
of
the
crash
.
“
Why
would
you
drive
drunk
or
high
and
jeopardize
others
’
lives
as
well
as
your
own
life
?
”
Cathy
Shelton
said
.
“
Why
?
Two
people
got
killed
over
your
stupidity
.
''
Cathy
Shelton
said
her
daughter
had
changed
her
regular
shift
at
work
in
order
to
get
off
early
so
she
could
perform
in
a
gospel
play
Tuesday
night
,
adding
the
play
had
been
“
all
she
talked
about
”
in
the
hours
before
she
was
killed
.

Chicago
Mayor
Rahm
Emanuel
released
a
statement
Tuesday
saying
:
>
One
victim
of
one
shooting
is
one
too
many
,
but
when
innocent
children
are
caught
in
the
crossfire
of
gun
violence
and
young
people
have
their
childhood
stolen
by
stray
bullets
,
our
consciences
are
shaken
and
our
hearts
are
broken
.
Every
parent
,
regardless
of
where
they
live
,
should
be
able
to
take
their
child
for
a
walk
to
the
park
or
a
ride
in
the
car
.
These
are
normal
rites
of
passage
of
childhood
.
>
>
These
shootings
must
be
a
turning
point
for
our
city
.
Anyone
with
information
about
these
crimes
owes
it
to
the
families
of
these
children
to
come
forward
.
Springfield
owes
it
to
the
residents
of
this
city
to
finally
pass
meaningful
gun
control
and
sentencing
legislation
to
keep
guns
out
of
the
hands
of
criminals
and
keep
repeat
violent
offenders
off
our
streets
.
And
our
criminal
justice
system
owes
it
to
all
of
us
to
give
violent
offenders
sentences
that
match
the
severity
of
the
crimes
they
have
committed
.

p.m.
Tuesday
,
according
to
the
Cook
County
Medical
Examiner
's
Office
.
The
boy

.
The
26-year-old

.
Lavontay
can
be

About
three
minutes
into
the
live
video
,
a
series
of
shots
ring
out
and
the
woman
flees
the
car
and
runs
to
the
home
of
someone
she
apparently
knows
.
``
Please
!
!
No
!
''
she
screams
.
She
can
be
heard
saying
she
'd
been
shot
in
the
stomach
,
a
child
had
been
shot
and
someone
else
was
shot
in
the
car
.
The
video
goes
dark
after
she
enters
the
home
,
but
the
audio
recording
continues
for
more
than
20
minutes
.
A
frenzied
scene
of
confusion
and
terror
can
be
heard
.
Police
later
confirmed
the
live
video
was
indeed
the
same
shooting
.
A
second
Facebook
video
apparently
posted
by
a
bystander
after
the
shooting
shows
police
officers
arrive
on
the
scene
.
In
the
video
,
the
female
victims
is
seen
holding
her
stomach
,
shaking
and
screaming
,
``
I
ca
n't
...
I
ca
n't
...
.I
did
n't
even
do
anything
...
I
did
n't
even
known
nobody
over
here
.
''
A
bystander
tells
her
to
go
lay
down
,
saying
,
``
She
got
a
bullet
in
her
stomach
.
''
The
female
victim
then
screams
:
``
He
died
.
''
!
[

[

Police
said
that
the
26-year-old
victim
was
released
from
prison
about
six
months
ago
,
but
did
not
have
further
information
on
his
conviction
Wednesday
.
He
has
been
arrested
“
multiple
times
''
for
charges
that
included
burglary
and
armed
robbery
,
according
to
Anthony
Guglielmi
,
police
spokesman
.
``
One
victim
of
one
shooting
is
one
too
many
,
''
Mayor
Rahm
Emanuel
said
in
a
statement
Tuesday
evening
,
``
but

the

went
on
to

``

''
After
the
shooting
,
police
inspected
the
maroon
car
in
the
alley
.
It
was
pock-
marked
with
bullet
holes
,
included
holes
in
the
rear
passenger
side
window
.
Chicago
Police
Supt
.
Eddie
Johnson
spoke
at
the
scene
of
the
crime
.
``
This
has
got
to
stop
somewhere
,
''
Johnson
said
.
``
Our
children
should
n't
have
to
keep
paying
the
price
for
our
inability
to
hold
repeat
gun
offenders
for
their
actions
.
...
My
gut
is
telling
me
when
we
finally
find
this
guy
,
we
're
going
to
find
he
's
a
repeat
gun
offender
.
''
No
one
was
in
custody
late
Tuesday
afternoon
,
but
investigators
suspect
the
man
was
the
intended
target
.
``
We
believe
that
this
was
a
targeted
shooting
,
so
these
people
were
looking
for
him
,
''
Johnson
said
.
A
source
said
police
have
leads
on
who
the
shooter
was
—
and
a
license
plate
.
No
arrests
have
been
made
.
``
We
have
very
promising
leads
,
''
Johnson
said
.
``
We
have
video
,
so
there
is
no
doubt
in
my
mind
that
we
will
find
him
.
But
the
issue
is
still
creating
a
culture
of
accountability
for
people
that
fire
weapons
,
and
we
are
just
not
doing
that
.
``
I
hope
our
legislative
partners
are
looking
right
now
,
''
Johnson
continued
.
``
We
have
yet
another
innocent
child
in
Chicago
that
can
lose
their
life
over
senseless
gun
violence
.
''
A
woman
who
works
in
a
business
near
Ogden
and
Kostner
avenues
said
,
``
I
just
heard
shots
,
and
that
was
it
.
It
had
to
be
over
10
shots
.
Oh
lord
,
I
do
n't
feel
safe
over
here
any
more
.
''
Another
witness
who
works
near
the
scene
of
the
slayings
noted
police
were
on
the
block
for
the
second
time
in
24
hours
.
On
Monday
evening
,
a
drive-by
shooting
in
the
4300
block
of
West
Ogden
Avenue
led
to
a
15-year-old
boy
being
[
grazed
in
his
leg
]

]
.
``
We
were
in
the
office
and
I
heard
5
or
6
shots
,
''
the
man
said
.
``
We
heard
a
car
spinning
before
it
sped
away
.
It
's
not
regular
people
doing
this
.
It
ca

be
regular
people

Ricardo
Munoz
(

,
who
visited
the
scene
shortly
after

said
the
shooting
happened
on
a
quiet
block

``
This

extremely
isolated
incident

Munoz
said

``
It

Police
said
a
14-year-old
girl
is
missing
after
she
was
last
seen
in
the
Englewood
neighborhood
.
Tykesa
Buggs
was
last
seen
near
the
1000-block
of
West
57th
Street
on
Feb.
6
.
She
was
seen
wearing
a
blue
ACE
shirt-a
school
shirt-black
pants
and
gray
cloth
boots
.
Police
describe
her
as
about
5
feet
2
inches
tall
,
with
a
medium
brown
complexion
and
burnt
orange
hair
.
She
last
made
contact
on
Feb.
6
.
Police
said
if
anyone
locates
her
,
they
should
call
911
or
Area
South
Special
Victim
's
unit
at
312-747-8380
.

Two
little
girls
were
shot
in
the
head
in
Chicago
,
two
more
innocents
swept
up
by
the
city
's
unending
river
of
street
gang
violence
.
And
as
I
write
this
,
reports
are
of
a
2-year-old
boy
fatally
shot
on
the
West
Side
.
Of
the
two
South
Side
girls
shot
in
the
head
Saturday
night
in
separate
attacks
,
one
clings
faintly
to
life
in
a
hospital
.
The
other
is
dead
.
And
now
comes
that
tired
,
familiar
cry
from
a
city
numbed
by
pain
:
When
will
it
stop
?
It
does
n't
stop
.
Takiya
Holmes
,
11
,
died
in
her
mother
's
arms
in
the
hospital
on
Tuesday
.
Kanari
Gentry
Bowers
,
12
,
is
unresponsive
,
on
life
support
.
If
one
thing
is
certain
,
Chicago
will
take
notice
,
become
officially
angry
,
the
politicians
will
say
what
politicians
say
,
and
then
Chicago
will
forget
their
names
,
just
as
Chicago
has
forgotten
the
names
of
other
children
swept
away
in
that
river
of
violence
.
Antonio
Smith
was
forgotten
,
and
Ryan
Banks
was
forgotten
,
and
the
list
of
the
city
's
murdered
children
continues
,
with
few
but
their
families
and
detectives
and
their
teachers
remembering
them
.

Speeches
wo
n't
stop
the
killings
,
torchlight
vigils
wo
n't
stop
it
.
Presidential
tweets
wo
n't
stop
it
,
and
mayoral
re-election
anxiety
wo
n't
stop
it
.
All
these
are
about
words
and
politics
,
but
words
and
politics
did
n't
enter
the
heads
of
those
little
girls
.
Bullets
entered
their
heads
.
Bullets
fired
by
human
beings
who
have
lost
their
humanity
,
who
do
n't
much
care
what
you
think
about
the
innocents
who
get
in
the
way
of
their
hot
revenge
.
To
have
any
hope
of
slowing
it
down
,
you
first
must
call
it
by
its
real
name
.
So
let
's
call
it
what
it
is
.
It
's
not
gun
violence
.
That
's
a
politically
correct
term
that
gives
politicians
wiggle
room
.
Children
shot
in
gang
wars
do
n't
need
your
flowers
or
speeches
.
But
they
do
require
specificity
.
It
's
not
gun
violence
.
It
's
street
gang
violence
.
And
it
's
street
gang
violence
in
a
few
Chicago
police
districts
,
mayhem
that
's
been
out
of
control
for
so
long
now
that
there
are
few
if
any
reasonable
responses
to
grief

Chicago
does
n't
need
more
public
handwringing
or
torchlight
demonstrations
for
TV
cameras
,
no
more
angry
frustrations
from
the
mouths
of
clergy
.
And
the
city
does
n't
need
finger
wagging
from
those
who
've
never
walked
a
crime
scene
,
who
demand
that
neighbors
turn
in
the
shooters
,
which
will
just
make
targets
of
their
own
children
.
All
of
that
is
just
empty
talk
.
What
's
required
are
concrete
steps
to
take
the
shooters
off
the
streets
.
Most
of
the
shooting
is
done
by
those
who
've
shot
before
,
violent
felons
who
carry
guns
because
they
're
worried
about
other
violent
felons
carrying
guns
.
They
do
n't
worry
about
going
to
prison
for
illegally
carrying
a
gun
,
because
most
do
only
a
year
or
so
behind
bars
and
come
out
,
spry
,
just
as
nihilistic
as
before
,
ready
to
shoot
again
and
again
.
Solutions
need
names
,
too
.
So
I
'll
give
this
one
a
name
:
The
Judicial
Accountability
Act
.
That
's
what
I
've
decided
to
call
legislation
that
is
taking
too
long
to
form
in
Springfield
,
hampered
by
the
jealousies
of
Chicago
politics
and
by
some
in
what
's
called
the
Black
Caucus
.
Chicago
police
Superintendent
Eddie
Johnson
has
been
pushing
this
idea
for
months
now
.
He
's
made
himself
physically
ill
pushing
it
.
Its
aim
is
to
lengthen
sentences
for
felons
already
previously
convicted
of
unlawful
use
of
weapons
charges
.
If
judges
decide
to
show
mercy
to
convicted
felons
who
illegally
carry
guns
,
the
judges
will
be
required
to
put
their
reasons
in
writing
.
If
judicial
mercy
leads
to
some
future
murder
,
the
judges
will
wear
the
jacket
for
it
.
Judges
hate
it
.
But
worrying
about
the
feelings
of
judges
,
and
there
are
many
good
judges
,
is
n't
what
's
important
here
.
What
's
important
is
getting
as
many
shooters
off
the
streets
as
quickly
as
possible
.
And
that
's
why
I
call
it
the
Judicial
Accountability
Act
.
State
Sen.
Kwame
Raoul
,
the
liberal
Chicago
Democrat
,
is
helping
form
this
policy
.
He
expects
to
have
some
hard
language
introduced
in
Springfield
next
week
,
he
told
me
on
Tuesday
.
House
Speaker
[
Michael
Madigan
]
[
3
]
,
the
political
boss
of
bosses
,
would
support
it
,
but
not
unless
the
Black
Caucus
is
supportive
.
Not
all
are
on
board
,
and
there
is
no
real
pressure
being
applied
to
them
.
Also
,
Cook
County
Board
President
Toni
Preckwinkle
is
n't
in
favor
of
it
,
and
her
political
protege
,
Cook
County
State
's
Attorney
Kimberly
Foxx
,
is
n't
loudly
pushing
the
idea
.
Foxx
was
elected
in
the
aftermath
of
the
Laquan
McDonald
fiasco
,
and
she
did
n't
campaign
as
a
law-and-order
candidate
.
Preckwinkle
sees
weakness
in
the
mayor
,
since
his
disastrous
handling
of
the
McDonald
case
,
and
is
n't
inclined
to
help
him
.
This
leaves
Raoul
to
walk
carefully
,
between
black
elected
officials
who
do
n't
want
to
be
identified
with
get-tough-on-crime
politics
,
and
the
reality
of
the
little
girls
getting
shot
in
the
head
.
One
political
way
out
from
the
impasse
is
to
reduce
some
drug
offenses
from
felonies
to
misdemeanors
as
a
way
of
buying
support
for
tougher
gun
sentencing
.
``
What
I
hear
from
detractors
,
it
's
that
,
'Well
,
these
individuals
are
just
carrying
,
they
have
n't
shot
anybody
yet
,
'
''
Raoul
told
me
.
``
My
response
is
that
we
should
n't
have
to
wait
until
they
've
shot
someone
.
``
If
they
've
been
previously
convicted
,
we
know
they
have
the
propensity
to
shoot
again
,
''
Raoul
said
.
``
We
have
to
get
them
off
the
streets
,
away
from
the
community
.
To
remove
them
so
they
may
be
rehabilitated
,
possibly
,
but
also
to
remove
them
from
the
community
to
protect
the
community
.
And
it
's
frustrating
.
''
Takiya
Holmes
was
n't
frustrated
by
politics
,
and
neither
is
Kanari
Gentry
Bowers
,
breathing
by
respirator
.
They
were
n't
political
at
all
.
They
're
little
girls
,
shot
in
the
head
,
in
the
gang
wars
of
Chicago
.

The
trends
:
DIY
Greenery
--
Pantone
Color
of
the
Year
2017
has
gone
green
–
and
it
’
s
so
easy
to
add
into
your
wedding
and
party
decor
with
textural
greens
,
fresh
from
the
garden
floral
arrangements
which
are
easy
to
DIY
since
they
are
more
gathered
,
loose
,
less
tight
and
structured
in
their
design
.
Just
add
into
any
color
floral
:
berries
,
greens
,
herbs
–
grocery
to
gorgeous
–
as
we
say
.
Think
Pink
The
Maison
Objet
the
design
show
in
Paris
featured
dusty
pink
.
Add
this
detail
into
your
place
settings
,
as
well
as
florals
and
mini
sweets
like
painted
pastel
angel
food
cakes
.
You
can
create
DIY
sweets
with
cookies
,
candies
from
the
grocery
.
They
are
easy
to
assemble
well
in
advance
,
so
you
aren
’
t
working
on
the
tiny
details
the
week
of
the
wedding
.
Scandi
Style
Neutrals
Whites
and
lights
are
in
for
2017
–
which
works
perfectly
with
every
single
venue
you
could
choose
.
Monofloral
(
monocolor
)
uses
one
floral
variety
and
one
hue
.
It
is
another
fast
,
easy
DIY
design
since
you
aren
’
t
mixing
different
blooms
and
colors
together
.
From
linen
to
china
to
stationery
details
like
printed
menus
–
keep
neutral
palettes
mixing
whites
and
ivories
–
which
is
very
pleasing
to
the
eye
.
You
do
not
need
to
match
everything
.
A
varied
palette
of
neutrals
is
more
pleasing
and
looks
more
residential
–
styled
–
adding
elegance
and
warmth
to
the
venue
.
Instead
of
serving
a
large
wedding
cake
the
trend
is
mini
personal
cakes
served
to
each
guest
–
a
very
fun
,
unique
end
to
the
wedding
meal
.

A
Cook
County
Judge
on
Saturday
ordered
held
without
bail
an
18-year-old
high
school
student
in
connection
with
a
failed
drug
heist
that
ended
with
five
people
shot
,
three
fatally
.
Three
days
after

in
a
Southwes
t
Side
home
in
the
Brighton
Park
neighborhood
,
Torrence
Reese
,
of
the
900
block
of
West
68th

in
the
Englewood
neighborhood
was
charged
with
three
counts
of
first-
degree
murder
.
Cook
County
Judge
Peggy
Chiampas
denied
him
bail
during
bond
court
Saturday
.
Reese
,
who
was
on
track
to
graduate
from
Jane
Addams
High
School
,
was
not
present
in
court
,
as
he
also
was
struck
by
gunfire
and
currently
is
hospitalized
with
gunshot
wounds
,
his
attorney
said
.
The
charges
are
tied
to
the
deaths
of
brothers
Emmanuel
Camacho
,
18
,
and
Filogonio
Rivera-Camacho
,
20
,
both
of

robbery
,
prosecutors
said
.
The
witness
,
who
was
not
named
,
was
the
fifth
person
shot
.
Prosecutors
said
the
witness
was
friends
with
the
brothers
and
also
knew
Reese
from
high
school
.
Because
he
knew
the
brothers
occasionally
sold
marijuana
from
their
apartment
,
and
Reese
was
interested
in
purchasing
2
ounces
of
marijuana
for
$
400
,
prosecutors
said
he
arranged
for
Reese
to
purchase
marijuana
from
the
brothers
.
About
2:45
p.m.
,
Reese
and
Julian
Miller
arrived

The
city
is
doubling
the
number
of
high-crime
polic
e
districts
equipped
with
ShotSpotter
gunfire
detectors
and
other
technology
tha
t
helps
to
deploy
officers
to
the
places
where
gun
violence
is
occurring
,
offici
als
said
Tuesday
.
ShotSpotter
sensors
were
already
in
the
Englewood
District
on
the
South
Side
and
Harrison
District
on
the
West
Side
under
a
pilot
program
started
by
then-
police
Supt
.
Garry
McCarthy
in
2012
.
Now
the
Deering
District
on
the
South
Side
and
Austin
District
on
the
West
Side
are
getting
the
same
technology
,
the
Chicago
Sun-Times
is
reporting
.
Under
police
Supt
.
Eddie
Johnson
and
Mayor
Rahm
Emanuel
,
the
number
of
SpotSpotter
sensors
in
Englewood
and
Harrison
was
recently
expanded
—
along
with
police
surveillance
video
cameras
.
Officers
have
been
provided
with
in-
car
computers
and
cell
phones
equipped
with
ShotSpotter
technology
,
which
allows
them
to
hear
shots
in
almost
real
time
and
see
the
location
of
the
shots
on
a
map
.
Also
,
Strategic
Decision
Support
Centers
have
been
installed
in
Englewood
and
Harrison
.
They
’
re
rooms
in
which
analysts
from
the
police
department
and
University
of
Chicago
Crime
Lab
review
the
gunfire
data
and
suggest
where
officers
should
be
deployed
.
The
city
is
in
the
process
of
installing
the
same
technology
in
Deering
and
Austin
,
said
Anthony
Guglielmi
,
a
spokesman
for
the
police
department
.
It
costs
about
$
1.5
million
to
equip
each
district
with
all
of
the
technology
,
he
said
.
Guglielmi
said
the
department
has
seen
“
a
lot
of
success
”
with
the
new
gunfire
intelligence
centers
in
Englewood
and
Harrison
.
Eventually
,
the
police
department
would
like
to
expand
the
technology
to
every
district
with
high
levels
of
gun
violence
,
he
said
.
Shooting
incidents
were
slightly
up
in
Englewood
and
down
in
Harrison
this
year
through
Feb.
17
compared
with
the
same
period
of
2016
.
Shootings
soared
in
both
districts
last
year
,
according
to
department
statistics
.

The
intersection
at
Wellington
and
Racine
*
John
Greenfield
Around
11
PM
on
Wednesday
,
January
18
,
Abigail
Kruger
was
sitting
on
her
couch
in
her
Lakeview
duplex
,
just
south
of
Wellington
and
Racine
,
when
the
evening
's
quiet
was
shattered
by
a
loud
bang
.
``
I
thought
it
was
a
gunshot
,
or
a
car
had
hit
a
light
pole
,
''
she
recalls
.
As
Kruger
went
to
her
first-floor
window
,
she
heard
a
short
burst
of
police
sirens
,
then
silence
again
,
followed
by
a
young
woman
crying
,
``
Help
,
someone
please
help
me
.
''
On
the
west
side
of
Racine
she
saw
19-year-old
Annie
Zidek
lying
on
the
pavement
,
surrounded
by
four
or
five
Chicago
police
officers
.
Kruger
ran
outside
.
She
says
she
thought
Zidek
had
been
shot
,
but
as
she
approached
the
teen
,
she
saw
a
dented
and
broken
bicycle
and
realized
that
she
had
been
struck
on
her
bike
.
Zidek
's
backpack
,
phone
,
and
one
of
her
shoes
were
scattered
across
the
street
.
Kruger
says
she
then
assumed
Zidek
had
been
the
victim
of
a
hit-and-run
.
But
the
motorist
who
injured
the
cyclist
was
actually
an
as
yet
unnamed
police
officer
who
sped
through
the
intersection
at
Wellington
and
Racine
—which
has
four-way
stop
signs—en
route
to
a
burglary
call
.
The
Chicago
Police
Department
now
argues
that
Zidek
was
at
fault
,
claiming
that
she
ran
her
stop
sign
,
and
that
the
officer
who
hit
her
had
activated
his
emergency
lights
before
he
went
through
the
intersection
.
However
,
Zidek
's
attorney
says
the
truth
about
the
crash
has
yet
to
be
determined
,
and
that
the
police
department
's
refusal
to
accept
responsibility
is
yet
another
example
of
our
city
's
larger
problem
of
police
accountability
.
Zidek
,
a
DePaul
undergraduate
,
was
on
her
way
home
from
work
at
a
Starbucks
near
Wellington
and
Broadway
when
she
was
struck
,
according
to
a
male
relative
who
asked
not
to
be
named
,
citing
fears
of
police
retaliation

In
the
aftermath
of
the
crash
,
Kruger
says
,
Zidek
lay
with
the
left
side
of
her
face
and
shoulder
on
the
asphalt
,
her
hips
rotated
toward
the
ground
.
Even
though
Kruger
did
n't
yet
know
an
officer
had
injured
Zidek
,
she
says
she
noticed
the
police
were
n't
doing
anything
to
comfort
the
victim
.
``
The
police
kept
asking
her
if
she
knew
what
had
happened
.
And
she
wanted
to
give
them
the
information
,
but
she
was
absolutely
blindsided
and
had
no
idea
,
''
Kruger
says
.
``
She
got
really
upset
and
started
to
cry
,
so
I
asked
them
to
stop
.
''
Kruger
waited
with
Zidek
until
an
ambulance
took
her
to
Advocate
Illinois
Masonic
Hospital
,
where
she
was
treated
for
a
broken
pelvis
and
leg
,
road
rash
,
and
injuries
to
her
face
,
according
to
her
male
relative
.
As
Kruger
walked
back
toward
her
house
,
she
saw
an
unmarked
Ford
Explorer
SUV
parked
diagonally
across
Racine
,
south
of
Zidek
's
bike
,
with
a
dented
hood
and
a
shattered
windshield
.
Kruger
then
realized
that
an
officer
had
struck
Zidek
.
``
I
was
so
frustrated
,
''
Kruger
says
.
``
The
police
knew
exactly
what
happened
.
''
Zidek
and
her
father
did
n't
respond
to
e-mails
sent
through
their
attorney
,
Antonio
Romanucci
of
Romanucci
&
Blandin
.
Zidek
was
recently
released
from
the
hospital
,
Romanucci
says
,
and
is
currently
undergoing
challenging
and
painful
physical
therapy
.
In
a
statement
last
week
,
CPD
spokesman
Kevin
Quaid
blamed
Zidek
for
the
crash
,
claiming
that
she
``
disregarded
a
stop
sign
''
and
that
the
officer
who
struck
Zidek
had
his
emergency
lights
activated
when
the
crash
occurred
.
Officers
responding
to
emergencies
may
disobey
traffic
rules
,
such
as
stopping
for
stop
signs
,
if
they
activate
their
lights
and
sirens
,
according
to
CPD
.
Police
also
have
the
option
not
to
turn
on
sirens
if
they
need
to
roll
up
on
a
crime
scene
quietly
,
as
long
as
it
's
safe
to
do
so
.
But
Romanucci
argues
that
this
does
n't
absolve
the
officer
who
struck
Zidek
,
if
it
's
found
that
he
was
``
acting
with
conscious
disregard
''
for
the
safety
of
others
.
According
to
both
Romanucci
and
Kruger
,
it
appears
that
no
third-party
witnesses
saw
the
moment
of
impact
.
There
are
no
traffic
cameras
at
Wellington
and
Racine
,
and
the
attorney
says
there
does
n't
seem
to
be
security
camera
footage
of
the
collision
.
But
late-model
police
vehicles
,
like
the
one
involved
in
the
crash
,
have
dash
cams
that
automatically
start
recording
when
emergency
lights
or
sirens
are
activated
,
CPD
confirmed
.
``
So
if
the
lights
were
on
,
then
the
dash
cam
was
on
,
and
we
should
find
out
if
they
're
telling
us
the
truth
,
''
Romanucci
says
.
``
We
know
that
the
Chicago
police
will
do
whatever
it
takes
to
hide
their
responsibility
and
misdeeds
and
misconduct
,
and
transparency
is
an
issue
with
revealing
police
misconduct
.
''
The
[
U.S.
Department
of
Justice
report
on
CPD
]
[
10
]
released
last
month
suggests
that
Romanucci
's
claims
are
n't
just
wild
accusations
.
The
DOJ
's
investigation
found
,
among
other
things
,
that
a
``
code
of
silence
''
exists
among
officers
.
``
One
way
to
cover
up
police
misconduct
is
when
officers
affirmatively
lie
about
it
or
intentionally
omit
material
facts
,
''
the
report
states
.
*
*

[
“
There
was
this
arrogance
being
displayed

,

call

—Abigail
Kruger
,
who
witnessed
the
aftermath
of
the
crash
**

*

Last
month
Romanucci
filed
a
Freedom
of
Information
Act
request
for
all
records
pertaining
to
the
crash
.
CPD
has
requested
an
extension
until
February
25
.
But
even
if
the
officer
who
struck
Zidek
did
activate
his
lights
,
Romanucci
argues
,
that
does
n't
free
him
from
responsibility
.
``
If
Annie
was
already
in
the
intersection
,
what
was
she
supposed
to
do
?
''
he
asks
.
``
They
ca
n't
just
plow
into
her
.
''
Kruger
agrees
:
``
There
was
this
arrogance
being
displayed
where
,
because
the
police
are
responding
to
a
call
,
they
're

to
stop
,
and
so
the
crash
was
Annie
's
fault
,
''
she
says
.
Adding
insult
to
injury
,
the
city
mailed
Zidek
a
$
1,192
bill
for
her
ambulance
ride
.
Romanucci
plans
to
file
a
lawsuit
against
the
city
on
her
behalf
,
although
he
says
it
's
not
certain
whether
she
'll
file
a
misconduct
complaint
with
the
police
department
.
Either
way
,
CPD
should
provide
the
dash-cam
footage
of
the
crash
,
just
as
it
would
if
the
officer
who
struck
Zidek
was
accused
of
harming
a
civilian
with
a
gun
and
not
a
vehicle
.
If
police
drive
in
a
manner
that
puts
the
lives
of
other
road
users
at
risk
,
that
's
completely
at
odds
with
their
mission
to
serve
and
protect
.

A
man
who
beat
murder
charges
due
to
a
technicality
earlier
this
year
was
shot
to
death
half
an
hour
after
bonding
out
of
the
Cook
County
Jail
late
Monday
on
separate
armed
robbery
charges
.
At
11:12
p.m.
,
Kamari
Belmont
was
released
from
jail
after
posting
10
percent
of
a
$
100,000
bond
,
according
to
the
Cook
County
sheriff
’
s
office
.
At
11:43
p.m.
,
the
23-year-old
was
riding
in
a
vehicle
less
than
a
mile
from
the
jail
when
a
white
SUV
pulled
alongside

someone
inside
opened
fire
,
hitting
him
in

back
and
torso
,
according

Police
.
At
11:57
p.m.
,

As
first
reported
by
the
Chicago
Tribune
,
Belmont
and
two
other
men
,
23-year-
old
Terrence
Hogans
and
21-year-old
Khalil
Powell
,
[
were
charged
with
a
pair
of
robberies
]
[

]
that
happened
within
an
hour
of
each
other
early
on
May
1
,
2015
,
police
said
at
the
time
.
Hogans
shot
one
of
the
victims
in
their
first
alleged
robbery
,
which
happened
about
2
a.m.
in
the
3700
block
of
South
Vincennes
,
Cook
County
prosecutors
said
at
their
bond
hearing
.
That
victim
,
40-year-old
North
Side
man
Sorrell
Marshall
,
died
three
weeks
later
of
complications
from
his
gunshot
wounds
.
The
trio
robbed
two
more
people
an
hour
later
in
the
first
block
of
East
21st
Street
,
but
police
were
able
to
track
them
down
using
a
mobile
tracking
application
on
a
victim
’
s
cellphone
in
the
500
block
of
West
43rd
Street
,
prosecutors
said
.
As
officers
approached
,
Hogans
got
out
of
the
vehicle
with
a
handgun
in
his
waistband
and
lunged
at
one
of
the
officers
with
a
forearm
to
the
chest
,
authorities
said
.
An
officer
shot
him
once
in
the
arm
and
chest
and
he
ran
away
,
prosecutors
said
.
The
other
two
men
were
arrested
,
as
was
Hogans
when
he
showed
up
at
Mercy
Hospital
.
An
autopsy
didn
’
t
immediately
rule
on
the
manner
of
Marshall
’
s
death
,
but
it
was
later
ruled
a
homicide
,
according
to
the
Cook
County
medical
examiner
’
s
office
.
Charges
against
the
men
were
later
upgraded
from
armed
robbery
to
murder
.
The
murder
charges
against
Belmont
were
dropped
Jan.
27
,
court
records
show
.
A
state
statute
stipulates
that
,
after
agreed
upon
continuances
,
a
person
accused
of
a
crime
who
is
still
in
custody
must
be
brought
to
trial
120
days
after
making
a
demand
.
Court
records
show
that
Belmont
made
a
demand
for
trial
on
April
15
,
2016
.
Between
May
2015
and
mid-January
2017
,
Belmont
’
s
attorneys
and
prosecutors
agreed
to
at
least
12
case
continuances
,
records
show
.
When
Belmont
’
s
charges
were
dropped
,
a
judge
set
bond
at
$
100,000
for
the
second
robbery
.
He
posted
10
percent
and
was
released
Monday
night
before
the
shooting

HYDE
PARK
—
Police
are
looking
for
a
man
who
touched
a
teenager
inappropriately
on
Saturday
morning
on
the
street
in
East
Hyde
Park
.
Police
issued
an
alert
after
a
man
walked
up
to
a
teenager
at
7:45
a.m.
Saturday
in
the
5100
South
Cornell
Avenue
and
after
striking
up
a
conversation
touched
the
boy
inappropriately
.
The
suspect
is
described
as
a
black
man
,
5-foot-11-inches
tall
in
his
30s
or
40s
with
a
gray
goatee
wearing
beige
jacket
,
dark
pants
and
a
black
hat
.
He

Whether
the
students
know
it
or
not
,
the
protests
that
turned
violent
at
Middlebury
College
over
an
appearance
March
2
by
conservative
scholar
Charles
Murray
ironically
—
and
deplorably
—
demonstrated
the
national
social
crackup
that
Murray
has
been
writing
about
.
Murray
's
2012
best-seller
``
Coming
Apart
:
The
State
of
White
America
,
1960-2010
''
presciently
described
the
emerging
socioeconomic
divide
that
,
among
other
developments
,
led
to
the
unexpected
rise
of
President
Donald
Trump
.
Since
the
1950s
,
Murray
argues
in
his
book
,
Americans
have
been
coming
apart
along
educational
and
economic
lines
.
Americans
with
more
than
a
high
school
education
or
skill
level
have
become
increasingly
isolated
from
the
less
well-
off
—
they
are
all
living
in
tribal
and
cultural
bubbles
.
I
called
``
Coming
Apart
''
the
most
important
book
of
2012
and
I
was
not
alone
.
Many
of
Murray
's
revelations
have
become
common
knowledge
.
For
those
with
fewer
skills
,
as
he
pointed
out
,
wages
have
stagnated
,
jobs
have
automated
or
moved
overseas
,
marriage
rates
have
plummeted
and
opiate
overdose
rates
have
soared
.
In
many
ways
,
these
were
the
``
forgotten
Americans
''
to
whom
Trump
said
,
``
I
am
your
voice
.
''
But
that
was
n't
the
book
that
aroused
the
Middlebury
mob
in
Vermont
—
the
violent
crowd
that
disrupted
Murray
's
visit
and
left
one
professor
injured
.
The
protesters
—
and
58
faculty
members
who
signed
a
petition
—
were
upset
because
Murray
co-authored
``
The
Bell
Curve
:
Intelligence
and
Class
Structure
in
American
Life
.
''
I
,
too
,
did
n't
care
a
lot
for
that
explosive
1994
best-seller
.
Co-authored
with
psychologist
Richard
J.
Herrnstein
,
it
set
the
stage
for
``
Coming
Apart
''
with
its
argument
that
a
high-intelligence
``
cognitive
elite
''
was
rising
and
separating
from
those
with
less
intelligence
.
But
it
also
argued
that
IQ
tests
are
a
better
measure
of
human
intelligence
than
numerous
other
experts
believe
,
that
intelligence
is
largely
the
result
of
inherited
traits
and
that
there
is
not
much
government
can
do
to
improve
the
outlook
of
people
who
are
born
less
gifted
cognitively
than
others
.
I
objected
to
that
book
because
I
thought
the
authors
were
too
quick
to
pin
poverty
,
crime
,
welfare
dependency
,
unwed
pregnancies
and
a
host
of
other
social
dysfunctions
on
low
IQ
—
and
too
reluctant
to
account
for
countless
other
cultural
,
familial
and
environmental
factors
.
But
,
as
much
as
I
hated
``
The
Bell
Curve
,
''
I
thought
Murray
redeemed
himself
with
his
2012
work
,
``
Coming
Apart
:
The
State
of
White
America
,
1960-2010
.
''
This
time
,
as
he
wrote
in
the
introduction
,
he
avoided
racial
suspicions
by
focusing
purely
on
white
Americans
,
a
group
that
has
been
struggling
increasingly
over
the
past
half-century
with
the
same
growing
income
inequality
,
family
breakdown
,
drug
addiction
and
other
social
disorder
that
has
too
often
been
identified
solely
with
the
black
underclass
.
As
opiate
addiction
rates
have
soared
among
displaced
working-class
whites
in
such
previously
unlikely
places
as
Vermont
and
small-town
Ohio
,
some
of
us
can
not
help
but
notice
the
increased
interest
in
treating
addiction
as
a
disease
,
not
a
crime
,
as
it
usually
was
when
the
crack
epidemic
ravaged
low-
income
black
neighborhoods
in
the
1980s
and
'90s
.
What
a
difference
perceptions
can
make
on
public
action
.
That
's
why
I
,
as
a
liberal
African-American
,
was
thankful
to
see
``
Coming
Apart
''
confirm
an
argument
I
had
been
making
for
years
:
Poverty
,
despite
some
media-driven
perceptions
,
is
not
an
issue
for
minorities
only
.
We
Americans
are
more
likely
to
come
together
across
racial
lines
in
the
fight
against
poverty
when
we
``
de-colorize
''
the
issue
.
Unfortunately
,
the
``
cognitive
elite
,
''
as
Murray
calls
us
,
his
fellow
members
of
the
college-educated
classes
,
have
become
increasingly
distanced
and
alienated
from
those
who
have
not
benefited
from
an
economy
that
rewards
brains
over
muscle
.
As
a
result
,
the
elite
's
isolation
grows
and
deepens
as
we
pull
back
into
our
bubbles
of
self-interest
and
tribal
loyalties
.
That
's
why
a
lot
of
us
in
the
so-called
cognitive
elite
or
``
coastal
elite
,
''
as
some
Trumpists
like
to
say
,
received
a
jolting
wake-up
call
on
election
night
with
Trump
's
upset
victory
.
He
's
not
the
best
messenger
for
the
woes
of
economically
struggling
Americans
,
but
he
found
the
right
message
.
Now
,
as
Republicans
struggle
to
find
a
way
to
replace
Obamacare
with
``
something
terrific
,
''
as
Trump
promised
,
Grand
Old
Party
leaders
are
surprised
to
find
how
divided
they
are
over
values
and
ideas
within
their
own
party
,
particularly
between
the
right
and
the
far-right
.
Bubbles
everywhere
.
That
,
too
,
offers
a
lesson
to
today
's
students
.
If
you
want
to
succeed
in
the
next
America
,
get
out
of
your
bubbles
.
The
world
outside
needs
you
.

dead
over
the
weekend
in
a
remote
community
on

two
people
in

report
,
authorities
said
Monday

Preliminary
reports

to
a
rural
address
north
of
the
town
of
Prewitt
,
said
McKinley
County
Sheriff
's
Deputy
Roberta
Jaramillo
.
``
A
female
saw
that
the
officer
was
down
and
called
dispatch
over
his
radio
,
''
Jaramillo
said
.
Navajo
police
were
already
on
the
scene
when
sheriff
's
deputies
and
New
Mexico
state
police
officers
arrived
.
Authorities
quickly
identified
a
suspect
and
the
search
intensified
as
daylight
broke
.
Footprints
helped
officers
to
track
the
suspect
,
who
was
taken
into
custody
early
Sunday

Thanks
to
my
softball
teammate
and
writer
Jack
Silverstein
(
@
readjack
)
for
pointing
out
why
the
South
Side
of
Chicago
needs
more
attention
than
it
is
getting
.
Maybe
my
transplant
status
as
a
45-year
north
sider/north
suburban
resident
represents
a
naive
viewpoint
to
the
needs
and
history
of
Chicago
's
forgotten
landscape
.
But
,
I
'll
tell
you
,
when
you
have
lived
and
grown
up
on
the
North
Side
,
if
there
's
a
reference
to
the
South
Side
,
it
all
means
the
same
-
whether
it
's
Bridgeport
,
Burnside
or
Beverly
,
it
makes
no
difference
.
It
's
just
a
wave-off
-
``
Oh
yeah
,
that
happened
on
the
south
side
.
''

Just
making
sure
you
read
that
:
**
35
people
were
shot
south
of
35th
Street
this
weekend
.
**
Can
you
wave
off
35
people
getting
shot
?
Having
lived
on
the
South
Side
for
four
years
now
,
it
is
painfully
obvious
that
city
services
and
high-level
government
attention
are
lacking
.
Ask
one
of
the
freshly
scrubbed
City
or
County
administrators
with
their
newly-minted
Masters
degrees
if
he
or
she
can
find
their
way
south
or
if
they
know
the
difference
between
Morgan
Park
and
Lincoln
Park
.
It
's
not
all
street
fests
and
craft
beer
,
I
can
tell
you
that
.
While
it
is
merely
my
perception
that
streets
do
n't
get
plowed
like
they
do
on
the
North
Side
and
that
retail
space
and
other
commercial
locations
remain
vacant
for
months
and
years
on
end
with
weeds
growing
unabated
,
it
is
not
just
my
perception
that
people
are
dying
at
higher
rates
than
my
northern
brethren
.
Unfortunately
,
it
is
too
readily
accepted
as
a
fact
of
life
.
Is
it
racial
?
Is
it
socio-economic
?
Simple
geography
(
farther
away
from
City
Hall
perhaps
)
?
After
four
years
,
I
'm
starting
to
really
feel
like
a
South
Sider
and
can
see
and
feel
the
difference
.
I
do
n't
have
answers
,
just
questions
at
this
point
.

Moments
after
Dominiq
Greer
held
a
news
conference
Wednesday
mor
ning
to
announce
a
lawsuit
seeking
$
15
million
from
the
city
—
alleging
a
Chicag
o
police
officer
wrongfully
shot
him
seven
times
—
police
officers
arrested
Gree
r
on
a
murder
warrant
as
he
waited
for
an
Uber
,
the
Chicago
Sun-Times
is
reporti
ng
.
“
I
had
no
clue
,
”
said
Eugene
Hollander
,
who
hosted
the
10
a.m.
news
conference
at
his
Loop
office
.
“
It
’
s
definitely
a
surprise
to
me
.
He
was
going
to
grab
an
Uber
back
home
and
as
he
was
waiting
a
squad
car
pulled
up.
”
Greer
,
26
,
a
convicted
felon
,
was
arrested
on
a
warrant
for
the
May
27
shooting
death
of
22-year-old
Kevin
Larry
,
but
has
yet
to
be
formally
charged
.
The
warrant
was
issued
May
29
.
“
We
became
aware
he
was
holding
a
press
conference
for
a
civil
suit
against
the
police
department
,
and
the
police
department
doesn
’
t
wait
to
apprehend
people
accused
of
murder
,
”
said
Anthony
Guglielmi
,
chief
spokesman
for
the
department
.
Police
found
Larry
dead
after
responding
to
a
call
of
shots
fired
in
the
5600
block
of
South
Wabash
,
police
spokeswoman
Ana
Pacheco
said
Wednesday
afternoon
.
The
victim
in
the
shooting
was
a
documented
gang
member
,
Pacheco
added
.
It
’
s
the
exact
same
block
where
two
years
earlier
Greer
’
s
good
friend
Brian
Weekly
was
shot
and
killed
after
surviving
two
separate
shootings
in
which
he
was
wounded
the
previous
month
.
A
police
source
confirmed
that
an
“
officer
safety
alert
”
was
issued
about
Greer
after
the
May
27
killing
.
The
alert
,
which
also
referred
to
Greer
by
an
alias
,
“
Domo
,
”
said
he
was
overheard
saying
he
would
“
not
be
taken
alive
,
”
the
source
said
.
“
He
should
be
considered
armed
and
dangerous
,
”
the
alert
said
.
At
the
press
conference
Wednesday
morning
,
Greer
said
he
obtained
a
gun
illegally
to
protect
himself
following
Weekly
’
s
death
.
He
said
he
was
carrying
the
gun
but
never
pulled
it
,
when
police
chased
and
shot
him
seven
times
—
the
basis
of
his
lawsuit
.
Greer
displayed
to
reporters
surveillance
camera
footage
on
a
flatscreen
TV
as
evidence
to
back
up
his
claim
that
a
Chicago
police
officer
shot
him
multiple
times
in
2014
as
he
tried
to
run
away
and
shot
him
again
as
he
lay
on
the
ground
.
Greer
,
who
told
reporters
Wednesday
that
he
was
not
in
a
gang
,
said
police
should
have
gotten
their
exercise
and
chased
him
down
instead
of
opening
fire
.
“
They
should
have
did
their
job
and
try
to
catch
me
instead
of
shooting
me
.
If
I
ain
’
t
never
bring
no
harm
to
you
,
why
would
you
bring
harm
to
me
,
”
said
Greer
hours
after
his
attorney
filed
a
lawsuit
against
the
city
and
two
police
officers
.
“
I
’
m
quite
sure
they
do
the
training
and
run
and
know
how
to
hold
their
breath
,
so
that
’
s
what
they
’
re
supposed
to
do
anyway
.
They
should
have
kept
chasing
me
.
I
see
if
I
turned
around
and
posed
a
threat
or
anything
to
you
,
but
I
just
tried
to
get
away
,
if
you
had
to
shoot
just
for
you
to
catch
me
,
I
don
’
t
know
what
else
to
tell
you
.
That
’
s
bad.
”
Under
their
current
use
of
force
policy
,
which
is
currently
under
review
,
the
Independent
Police
Review
Authority
found
the
shooting
justified
last
year
and
closed
the
case
.
The
shooting
took
place
in
the
Englewood
neighborhood
in
the
early
morning
hours
over
the
July
4
weekend
of
2014
.
Greer
admits
he
was
carrying
an
unregistered
handgun
at
the
time
.
He
said
didn
’
t
normally
carry
a
gun
but
got
one
because
the
shooting
death
of
his
close
friend
Weekly
,
which
caused
him
to
begin
fearing
for
his
life
.
Greer
said
he
never
reached
for
the
gun
when
police
approached
him
and
two
friends
as
the
group
walked
on
the
7400
block
of
South
Princeton
.
They
were
heading
from
the
home
of
one
friend
who
was
on
house
arrest
to
the
home
of
another
friend
,
Greer
said
.
He
ran
a
few
steps
before
he
was
shot
three
times
:
in
the
right
arm
,
right
leg
and
left
big
toe
.
The
video
shows
Greer
stumbling
and
falling
.
Moments
after
he
regained
his
feet
and
continued
to
run
,
a
police
officer
enters
the
video
with
gun
drawn
.
Greer
claims
the
same
officer
,
Lawrence
Cosban
—
a
four
year
police
veteran
who
is
named
in
the
lawsuit
—
shot
Greer
another
four
times
from
close
range
as
Greer
lay
on
the
ground
further
down
the
alley
—
at
which
point
he
is
a
mere
shadow
on
the
black-and-white
video
.
“
He
was
just
standing
around
with
two
of
his
friends
in
the
street
,
he
sees
the
police
roll
up
and
he
takes
off
.
When
you
’
re
an
African
American
in
Englewood
,
it
’
s
understandable
,
”
Hollander
said
.
“
I
thought
I
was
[
going
to
]
die
,
”
Greer
said
Tuesday
.
“
I
asked
them
why
they
was
shooting
me
like
that
so
many
times
.
.
.
they
just
stayed
on
their
walkie
talkies
,
”
Greer
said
.
Greer
spent
eight
days
in
Stroger
Hospital
after
the
shooting
and
was
then
transferred
to
Cook
County
Jail
,
where
she
stayed
for
seven
months
because
he
couldn
’
t
afford
bail
.
A
charge
of
attempted
murder
of
a
police
officer
was
eventually
dropped
,
Hollander
said
.
But
an
unlawful
use
of
a
weapon
charge
is
still
pending
.
Video
of
the
shooting
,
which
was
recorded
by
the
surveillance
camera
of
a
private
business
,
was
not
posted
to
a
new
IPRA
website
because
evidence
only
from
cases
that
are
currently
pending
are
posted
to
the
site
,
IPRA
spokeswoman
Mia
Sissac
said
Wednesday
.
Greer
said
he
moved
to
South
Suburban
Posen
to
get
away
from
Chicago
police
.
“
I
try
to
stay
away
from
them
,
”
he
said
.
“
My
whole
life
I
’
ve
been
getting
harassed
,
smacked
around
and
everything
by
the
police
,
so
I
’
m
just
trying
to
stay
away
from
them
cause
it
seems
like
I
can
’
t
do
nothing
to
them
so
if
anything
do
come
up
I
’
m
always
going
to
be
the
bad
guy
even
if
I
’
m
in
the
right.
”
Greer
has
a
conviction
for
a
2011
drug
arrest
.
He
also
was
convicted
of
domestic
battery
in
2013
.

There
's
been
some
speculation

near

park
.
Police
said
they

of
an
electronics
store
in
the
[

]
[

.
A
third

was
shot
and
killed
by
the

.
John

]
[

The
officers
spotted
three
men
inside
,
then
surrounded
the
business
,
announced
they
were
the
police
and
knocked
on
the
doors
,
trying
to
get
the
men
to
surrender
,
according
to
Pat
Camden
,
a
spokesman
for
the
Fraternal
Order
of
Police
,
which
represents
the
department
's
rank-and-file
.
But
the
three
men
--
Givens
,
Dudley
and
David
Strong
,
27
--
continued
to
load
stolen
goods
into
a
car
belonging
to
the
store
's
owner
that
was
parked
inside
the
business
,
Camden
said
.
The
men
got
in
the
car
and
tried
to
escape
by
driving
through
a
metal
door
,
Camden
said
.
The
swerving
car
struck
an
officer
and
a
squad
car
,
and
then
raced
toward
several
other
officers
,
Camden
said
.
The
officers
opened
fire
,
he
said
.
Strong
,
of
the
1600
block
of
North
Lockwood

,
was
dead

to
the
Cook

's
office
.
The

contusions
,
Camden
said
.
Police
recovered
a
cache
of
stolen
electronics
and
other
goods
inside
the
car
,
Camden
said
.
Givens
and
Dudley
were
each
charged
with
murder
because
Strong
died
during
the
commission
of
a
crime
,
authorities
said
.
Givens
,
who
police
say
was
behind
the
wheel
of
the
stolen
car
,
was
also
charged
with
aggravated
battery
to
a
police
officer
.
All
three
men
had
felony
convictions
on
their
record
,

Dudley
,
who
was
out
on
parole
for
concurrent
2002
and
2004
convictions
,
according
to
state
records
.
Both
men
are
scheduled
to
have
their
charges
heard
in

CHATHAM
--
One
of
the
women
[
found
stabbed
in
a
burned
out
Chatham
apartment
]
[
3
]
was
``
working
on
herself
,
''
a
friend
says
.
Cherie
Adams
,
43
,
and
her
daughter
,
Curtria
Duncan
,
24
,
were
found
in
a
bathroom
with
multiple
stab
wounds
after
a
Wednesday
afternoon
fire
in
their
apartment
,
according
to
the
Cook
County
Medical
Examiner
's
Office
.
Firefighters
responded
to
a
blaze
in
the
8100
block
of
South
Maryland
Avenue
about
3:30
p.m.
,
a
fire
department
official
said
.
Authorities
say
they
are
investigating
the
fire
as
arson
.
Duncan
died
from
suffocation
and
several
``
sharp
force
injuries
,
''
according
to
an
autopsy
released
Thursday
by
the
Cook
County
Medical
Examiner
's
Office
.
Adams
'
died
from
several
``
sharp
and
blunt
force
injuries
''
according
to
the
autopsy
.
Both
deaths
were
ruled
homicides
.
Rochelle
Pinex
,
whose
father
dated
Adams
for
years
and
said
Adams
and
Duncan
were
like
family
,
said
the
women
were
friendly
though
they
did
n't
have
too
many
friends
.
``
They
stayed
to
themselves
,
''
Pinex
said
.
``
I
do
n't
know
how
anybody
could
do
this
to
them
.
''
Adams
'
friend
Debra
Otis
,
who
lives
nearby
,
said
the
mother
and
daughter
were
close
.
``
Whenever
you
seen
her
,
she
was
with
her
mama
,
''
Otis
,
46
,
said
of
Duncan
.
Duncan
was
an
intelligent
woman
and
a
student
at
Kennedy-King
College
,
Otis
said
.
Adams
was
a
self-employed
beautician
who
often
would
give
discounts
to
clients
who
could
n't
pay
and
let
them
pay
her
back
later
,
Otis
said
.
``
She
was
a
beautiful
person
,
''
Otis
said
.
After
struggling
with
drugs
,
Adams
``
was
working
on
herself
,
''
she
said
.
Otis
``
broke
down
crying
''
when
she
learned
the
women
were
dead
,
she
said
.
Otis
said
she
did
not
know
why
anyone
would
want
to
kill
Duncan
,
who
had
a
young
son
named
Michael
,
who
's
around
4
.
The
boy
did
not
appear
to
be
in
the
apartment
at
the
time
of
the
fire
,
police
said
.
But
Duncan
's
mother
recently
got
into
an
intense
fight
with
a
neighbor
,
which
made
Otis
worry
about
her
safety
.
``
To
have
something
like
that
happen
in
the
community
,
it
's
scary
,
''
she
said
.

Little
Jonylah
Watkins
was
transported
to
Comer
Children
's
Hospital
at
least
five
hours
of
surgery
.
The
girl
's
father
,
Jonathan
Watkins
,
25
,
also
was
shot
multiple
times
.
Both
were
listed
in
critical
condition
Tuesday
.
The
father
was
being
treated
at
Northwestern
Memorial
Hospital
.
Meanwhile
,
Chicago
police
said
they
were
still
trying
to
find
the
gunman
.
``
She
's
six
months
old
.
For
a
person
to
do
that
,
what
kind
of
heart
?
''
grandmother
Mary
Young
said
.
Young
and
other
members
of
the
family
were
keeping
vigil
at
Comer
's
Tuesday
,
hoping
Jonylah
would
pull
through
.
``
We
hope
she
gets
through
everything
and
the
person
who
did
it
,
they
need
to
come
through
and
turn
themselves
in
,
''
said
relative
Dominique
Young
.
Jonylah
was
in
a
minivan
with
her
father
Monday
at
the
time
of
the
shooting
.
Police
say
the
father
was
changing
the
baby
's
diaper
in
the
front
seat
when
a
gunman
walked
up
and
shot
them
both
.
The
gunman
got
away
in
a
waiting
car
,
according
to
authorities
.
Relatives
actually
heard
the
gunfire
a
couple
blocks
away
and
rushed
to
the
scene
.
``
There
is
always
someone
getting
shot
in
this
neighborhood
.
We
are
close
together
and
we
know
them
.
There
are
killings
all
the
time
,
''
said
relative
Tiffany
Young
.
Investigators
say
they
believe
the
shooting
might
have
been
gang
related
.
They
say
Jonathan
Watkins
had
previous
gang
affiliations
.
Community
leaders
,
meanwhile
,
continue
their
calls
for
an
end
to
the
violence
.
They
are
also
urging
anyone
with
information
on
the
gunman
to
come
forward
.
``
Anytime
you
shoot
someone
,
period
,
it
is
a
very
cowardly
act
.
And
for
a
baby
to
be
shot
,
it
is
despicable
,
and
for
us
to
allow
this
to
happen
in
our
community
and
not
be
vocal
about
it
,
is
just
as
bad
,
''
Pastor
Corey
Brooks
said
.
Brook
also
said
his
New
Beginnings
Church
was
offering
a
$
5,000
for
information
leading
to
the
arrest
of
the
gunman
.
Chicago
police
reportedly
were
looking
into
a
claim
that
someone
possibly
threatened

Garrett
,
35
,
was
charged
with
two
counts
of
reckless
homicide
and
aggravated
driving
under
the
influence
of

for
the

The
victims

were
angry
and
outraged
that
Garrett
was
granted
bond
.
``
I
believe
he
should
be
in
jail
,
''
Julian
Garcia
,
Joaquin
Garcia
's
uncle
,
said
.
Garrett
was
not
at
the
hearing
.
He
remains
hospitalized
with
a
fractured
hip
.
If
he
posts
10-percent
of
the
bail
money
,
Garrett
will
have
to
wear
an
electronic
monitor
.
``
It
's
not
right
that
two
lives
were
taken
.
Two
lives
gone
and
he
has
gotten
a
slap
on
the
wrist
,
''
Joaquin
Garcia
's
mother
Asuncion
Torres
said
.
Walking
arm
in
arm
,
the
victims
'
mothers
,
Asuncion
Torres
and
Cecilia
Garcia
,
had
never
met
each
other
until
Garrett
's
bond
hearing
brought
the
two
mothers
together
.
Torres
'
mother
spoke
publicly
for
the
first
time
Sunday
``
It
is
so
unnatural
for
a
mother
to
bury
her
child
,
''
Asuncion
Torres
said
.
``
It
is
so
unnatural
,
so
unjust
.
''
While
the
Torres
and
Garcia
families
showed
pictures
and
held
posters
for
justice
,
Garrett
's
attorney
walked
out
of
court
with
two
people
believed
to
be
relatives
of
the
officer
.
They
refused
to
comment
.
Investigators
said
Garrett
was
off-duty
and
driving
drunk
in
the
wrong
direction
at
more
than
60
miles
an
hour
in
a
45-mile-an-hour
zone
.
Garrett
remains
on
leave
from
the
North
Chicago
Police
Department
that
he
joined
in
August
2008
.
Officials
say
Garrett
admitted
to
being
out
drinking
because
it
was
his
birthday
.
Joaquin
Garcia
was
studying
to
be
a
surgical
technician
and
set
to
graduate
in
May
from
Malcolm
X
College
,
with
plans
to
go
on
to
the
University
of
Illinois
at
Chicago
for
a
bachelor
's
degree

When
the
suspects
in
the
high-profile
slaying
of
15-year-old
Hadiya
Pendleton
stepped
up
to
the
bench
Thursday
for
what
was
supposed
to
be
a
routine
arraignment
,
the
judge
announced
an
eye-popping
figure
that
seemed
anything
but
typical
.
Michael
Ward
,
who
is
accused
of
being
the
gunman
,
faced
141
counts
of
first-
degree
murder
--
in
a
case
with
one
fatality
.
The
number
raised
eyebrows
in
the
courtroom
and
prompted
Ward
's
attorney
to
blast
Cook
County
State
's
Attorney
Anita
Alvarez
for
what
he
said
was
grandstanding
in
a
case
that
has
brought
international
attention
--
and
the
focus
of
the
White
House
--
to
Chicago
's
scourge
of
gun
violence
.

``
I
want
to
ask
(
Alvarez
)
:
'Why
are
you
doing
this
?
'
''
attorney
Jeffrey
Granich
said
after
Ward
and
co-defendant
Kenneth
Williams
entered
formal
pleas
of
not
guilty
.
``
It
's
ridiculous
and
stupid
.
It
's
an
extremely
cheap
way
of
getting
attention
.
''
Alvarez
's
spokeswoman
,
Sally
Daly
,
responded
Thursday
night
to
the
criticism
,
saying
,
``
It
's
simply
not
true
at
all
.
``
It
is
common
for
this
office
to
bring
all
of
the
applicable
charges
at
this
juncture
of
the
case
,
and
that
's
what
was
done
here
,
''
she
said
.
Daly
would
not
elaborate
on
the
specific
counts
against
Ward
,
but
legal
experts
and
former
prosecutors
told
the
Tribune
it
's
typical
to
use
the
preliminary
stage
of
indictment
as
a
catchall
,
especially
when
evidence
is
still
coming
in
and
a
case
remains
fluid
.
The
strategy
is
to
capture
as
many
theories
about
a
crime
as
possible
,
then
drop
counts
that
do
n't
fit
the
evidence
before
trial
,
they
said
.
A
number
of
recent
cases
--
both
high-profile
investigations
and
those
that
flew
under
the
media
radar
--
seem
to
bear
that
out
.
When
William
Balfour
was
charged
in
2008
in
the
sensational
slayings
of
singer
Jennifer
Hudson
's
mother
,
brother
and
nephew
,
a
grand
jury
returned
an
indictment
that
included
53
counts
of
murder
.
He
was
eventually
tried
and
convicted
on
13
of
those
counts
as
well
as
other
charges
of
home
invasion
and
kidnapping
.
In
a
lesser-known
case
,
gang
member
Kenneth
Hatcher
was
accused
in
2011
of
killing
one
teen
and
wounding
three
others
at
a
South
Side
bus
stop
.
He
was
charged
in
a
122-count
indictment
that
included
96
counts
of
first-degree
murder
,
court
records
show
.
He
went
to
trial
on
just
three
murder
counts
.
He
was
convicted
.
Kelly
Navarro
,
who
spent
16
years
as
a
Cook
County
prosecutor
,
said
returning
an
indictment
with
dozens
of
counts
is
a
move
that
most
veteran
criminal
defense
attorneys
understand
and
expect
.
``
You
want
to
throw
in
everything
you
can
conceivably
think
of
,
''
said
Navarro
,
who
now
is
associate
director
of
the
Center
for
Advocacy
at
the
John
Marshall
Law
School
.
``
Sometimes
a
count
will
look
not
so
strong
but
at
trial
it
becomes
stronger
.
So
you
do
n't
want
to
rule
things
out
.
''
The
number
of
murder
charges
can
also
skyrocket
for
those
accused
of
firing
a
gun
because
numerous
subsections
in
state
law
provide
for
enhanced
penalties
for
discharging
a
firearm
and
causing
a
death
.
Robert
Loeb
,
a
longtime
criminal
defense
lawyer
and
law
professor
at
DePaul
University
,
said
he
understood
the
number
of
charges
is
affected
by
combinations
of
factors
,
but
the
141
counts
against
Ward
was
one
among
the
most
he
could
recall
.
``
It
's
very
common
that
they
charge
a
single
murder
in
multiple
ways
,
but
141
is
very
uncommon
,
''
Loeb
said
.
Prosecutors
have
said
Ward
,
18
,
confessed
to
police
that
he
and
Williams
,
20
,
were
driving
around
on
Jan.
29
looking
for
rival
gang
members
to
shoot
when
they
passed
Harsh
Park
and
spotted
Hadiya
's
group
,
relaxing
after
final
exams
and
taking
shelter
from
the
rain
under
a
canopy
.
After
Williams
handed
him
a
gun
,
Ward
crept
up
on
the
group
and
fired
six
shots
,
prosecutors
said
.
Hadiya
,
a
sophomore
at
King
College
Prep
who
had
recently
performed
with
her
high
school
band
at
President
Barack
Obama
's
inauguration
festivities
,
was
fatally
shot
in
the
back
.
Two
other
students
were
wounded
,
while
10
people
who
were
part
of
the
group
escaped
injury
,
prosecutors
said
.
After
Thursday
's
brief
court
hearing
,
Hadiya
's
father
,
Nathaniel
Pendleton
,
told
reporters
the
arraignment
marked
the
beginning
of
``
a
long
road
we
got
ta
cross
,
''
but
he
expressed
confidence
that
justice
would
be
done
on
his
daughter
's
behalf
.
``
We
're
just
trying
to
make
good
things
happen
from
something
bad
,
''
he
said
after
noting
that
his
wife
and
he
are
starting
a
foundation
to
encourage
nonviolence
and
combat
gun
violence
.
Both
Ward
and
Williams
were
charged
in
the
indictment
with
first-degree
murder
,
attempted
murder
,
aggravated
battery
,
aggravated
discharge
of
a
firearm
and
mob
action
.
Ward
,
though
,
faces
124
more
counts
of
murder
than
his
co-defendant
.
The
counts
multiply
quickly
because
Ward
was
hit
with
additional
charges
of
murder
for
shooting
into
a
crowd
.
He
was
charged
with
murder
for
each
person
fired
upon
,
regardless
of
whether
they
were
struck
.
There
were
12
other
victims
in
the
park
,
including
the
10
victims
who
were
shot
at
but
not
struck
,
according
to
prosecutors
.
For
each
of
those
victims
,
Ward
was
charged
with
variations
of
the
murder
statute
because
Hadiya
was
killed
in
the
course
of
the
``
forcible
felony
''
of
firing
the
gun
.
David
Erickson
,
a
former
first
assistant
under
ex-State
's
Attorney
Dick
Devine
and
a
retired
appellate
judge
,
said
prosecutors
would
be
loath
to
bring
so
many
counts
to
trial
.
Not
only
is
it
unwieldy
but
it
also
could
confuse
the
jury
.
``
You
do
n't
want
to
go
with
counts
that
may
not
work
with
a
jury
,
''
he
said
.
``
And
you
do
n't
want
counts
that
are
inconsistent
.
''
Matthew
McQuaid
,
Williams
'
attorney
,
said
he
had
not
seen
defendants
hit
with
so
many
criminal
counts
in
his
some
20
years
of
practicing
law
,
but
he
expects
most
of
the
counts
to
be
dismissed
before
trial
.
``
Was
it
to
make
a
splash
?
Who
knows
?
''
McQuaid
said
to
a
throng
of
news
media
at
the
Leighton
Criminal
Court
Building
.
``
Maybe
they
're
being
thorough
and
careful
,
but
I
've
never
seen
these
many
charges
in
a
murder
case
.

A
South
Side
teenager
allegedly
shot
and
seriously
wounded
a
video
game
buddy
because
he
expressed
no
interest
in
joining
a
gang
.
“
I
’
m
gon
na
do
what
I
have
to
do
,
”
Cook
County
prosecutors
said
River
Williams
proclaimed
before
shooting
the
15-year-old
victim
six
times
in
the
chest
,
arms
and
legs
.
“
It
’
s
over
for
you.
”
Minutes
before
on
Nov.
27
,
the
pair
had
been
playing
video
games
at
Williams
’
home
,
assistant
Cook
County
state
’
s
attorney
Joell
Zahr
said
.
Williams
’
father
later
took
the
two
boys
to
45th
and
Marshfield
where
Williams
greeted
four
Hispanic
males
and
shook
their
hands
,
Zahr
said
.
Williams
assured
his
friend
he
knew
the
group
and
they
all
went
to
a
nearby
park
,
Zahr
said
.
At
some
point
,
the
victim
saw
one
of
the
Hispanic
males
hand
Williams
a
gun
,
which
Williams
proceeded
to
place
in
his
waistband
and
cover
with
his
shirt
,
Zahr
said
.
Then
,
while
walking
to
a
store
at
46th
and
Damen
,
Williams
allegedly
asked
his
friend
if
he
wanted
to
be
a
“
Latin
Saint.
”
The
friend
said
,
“
no
,
”
but
Williams
,
15
,
repeated
the
question
,
Zahr
said
.
This
time
the
boy
froze
and
did
not
answer
,
prompting
Williams
to
fire
at
his
friend
,
Zahr
said
.
Williams
and
the
other
males
then
ran
away
as
the
victim
fell
to
the
ground
,
Zahr
said
.
The
injured
boy
was
eventually
able
to
get
up
and
walk
to
a
nearby
gas
station
and
seek
help
.
The
victim
,
who
had
to
undergo
multiple
surgeries
,
told
authorities
who
shot
him
,
Zahr
said
.
Williams
also
allegedly
admitted
to
a
family
member
that
he
had
shot
someone
.
Williams
,
of
the
6300
block
of
South
Vernon
,
was
previously
found
delinquent
as
a
juvenile
for
aggravated
robbery
.
He
was
arrested
for
the
November
shooting
at
his
father
’
s
home
,
in
the
10500
block
of
South
Wabash
,
earlier
this
week
.
Marcus
Morris
said
his
son
is
a
freshman
at
Harlan
Community
Academy
High
School
.
Williams
had
to
repeat
the
ninth
grade
because
“
he
wouldn
’
t
take
his
butt
to
school
and
was
always
getting
in
trouble
,
”
Morris
said
in
a
telephone
interview
following
his
son
’
s
bond
hearing
Friday
.
Morris
said
his
son
was
picked
up
for
the
shooting
in
December
but
then
was
released
.
Although
Morris
described
Williams
as
a
good
kid
,
he
also
said
he
and
his
friends
are
often
“
toting
guns.
”
When
asked
if
his
son
was
in
gang
,
Morris
said
,
“
That
’
s
not
something
I
’
d
know
about.
”
Judge
Edward
Harmening
ordered
Williams
held
in
lieu
of
$
800,000
bail
.

A
Polish
immigrant
has
admitted
he
was
so
upset
about
his
divorce
that
he
offered
what
he
thought
were
hit
men
$
45,000
to
burn
alive
six
people
he
blamed
for
breaking
up
his
marriage
.
Zenon
Grzegorczyk
,
51
,
shook
his
head
in
apparent
shame
as
he
pleaded
guilty
Thursday
to
the
botched
plot
to
kill
a
half
dozen
people
on
the
Northwest
Side
and
suburbs
.
Grzegorczyk
,
of
Des
Plaines
,
was
originally
suspected
of
trying
to
buy
assault
rifles
,
grenades
and
other
weapons
for
a
group
in
Poland
.
But
when
undercover
officers
from
the
U.S.
Bureau
of
Alcohol
,
Tobacco
,
Firearms
and
Explosives
and
the
Cook
County
sheriff
’
s
office
met
with
him
in
April
2012
,
posing
as
arms
dealers
,
he
told
them
he
wanted
a
woman
killed
.
Grzegorczyk
was
at
one
point
was
so
suspicious
of
the
undercover
feds
that
he
asked
to
meet
at
a
bathhouse
,
where
they
couldn
’
t
wear
a
wire
.
But
eventually
he
told
the
agents
he
wanted
six
people
burned
to
death
before
a
June
2012
wedding
.
He
admitted
to
U.S.
District
Judge
Elaine
Bucklo
on
Thursday
that
he
’
d
handed
the
agents
a
$
3,000
down
payment
from
a
duffle
bag
at
a
Northwest
Side
McDonalds
,
and
that
he
’
d
promised
them
another
$
42,000
if
they
carried
out
the
murders
.
Despite
his
confession
,
Grzegorczyk
told
Bucklo
he
originally
“
wanted
to
have
them
to
kill
only
two
people
”
but
that
he
was
persuaded
to
have
four
others
killed
to
have
the
whole
thing
over
and
done

**CHICAGO
(
CBS

**-
Thieves
made
off
with
more
than
two
dozen
iPads
after
using
a
small
sledhammer
to
bust
off
the
locks
at
a
North
Lawndale
school
.
The
incident
happened
at
James
Weldon
Johnson
Elementar
y
school
on
Friday
-
around
5:45
p.m.
That
's
when
police
say
at
least
two
people
broke
into
the
school
and
made
off
with
the
hardware
.
Investigators
say
the
thief
or
thieves
used
a
sledgehammer
to
break
a
lock
and
gain
access
to
the
computer
equipment
.
30
iPads
,
a
Macbook
Pro
laptop
and
other
computer
items
were
taken
from
a
cart
inside
a
third
floor
computer
lab
.
CBS

has
been
told
janitors
doing
normal
duties
discovered
the
break-in
around
7:30
Friday
night
.
Parents
CBS
2
talked
to
parents
who
say
they
're
frustrated
.
``
We
're
already
trying
to
better
our
schools
and
for
our
kids
and
then
you
take
from
the
kids
?
I
think
that
's
just
awful
,
”
said
Tiffany
Ball
.
The
computer
lab
is
a
common
area
where
students
and
faculty
spend
time
throughout
the
day
.
So
far
no
one
is
in
custody…
and
this
investigation
continues

Spokeswoman
Denise
Kipekey
says
one
in
three
teenagers
are
affected
by
dating
violence
,
not
all
victims
themselves
,
but
friends
with
people
who
have
been
.
“
They
are
in
constant
contact
with
each
other
,
they
can
follow
the
other
constantly
,
”
Kipekey
said
.
“
There
are
apps
out
there
that
allow
people
to
find
their
friend
and
follow
them
every
minute
of
the
day.
”
Kipekey
says
social
media
has
increased
the
violence
because
it
's
so
immediate
and
people
do
n't
have
time
to
cool
down
after
getting
angry
at
each
other
.

In
a
hearing
that
lasted
less
than
15
minutes
Monday
morning
,
a
nor
th
suburban
man
pleaded
guilty
to
first-degree
murder
and
will
likely
spend
the
rest
of
his
life
in
prison
for
the
deaths
of
his
wife
and
mother
.
Billy
Varner
,
of
Antioch
,
k
illed
his
wife
with
a
machete
and
suffocated
his
mother
last
October
,
the
Lake
County
News-Sun
is
reporting
.
Under
a
negotiated
plea
,
Varner
,
who
is
55
years
old
,
was
sentenced
to
45
years
in
prison
,
a
sentence
that
must
be
served
in
full
.
If
he
lives
long
enough
to
be
released
and
placed
on
parole
,
he
would
be
either
99
or
100
years
old
,
depending
on
the
exact
credit
he
is
given
for
time
spent
in
Lake
County
Jail
.
Asked
by
Judge
Mark
Levitt
whether
he
wanted
to
make
a
statement
,
Varner
responded
that
“
I
’
m
sorry.
”
Varner
,
who
has
an
eighth-grade
education
and
said
he
is
dyslexic
,
repeatedly
told
the
judge
that
he
understood
terms
of
the
plea
and
that
he
voluntarily
signed
a
waiver
of
trial
form
.
“
Obviously
,
it
’
s
effectively
a
life
sentence
,
”
said
Assistant
State
’
s
Attorney
Ari
Fisz
,
who
prosecuted
the
case
with
Assistant
State
’
s
Attorney
Matt
DeMartini
.
Fisz
said
after
the
verdict
that
the
families
of
the
victims
and
all
of
the
police
departments
involved
in
the
double
homicide
investigation
“
felt
it
was
a
just
disposition.
”
Varner
was
represented
by
defense
attorneys
John
Bailey
and
Thomas
Meyers
.
Bailey
declined
to
comment
on
the
resolution
of
the
case
.
Varner
was
charged
with
33
counts
of
first-degree
murder
for
the
deaths
of
his
wife
,
Peggy
Henderson
,
61
,
and
his
mother
,
Dorothy
Varner
,
82
,
and
two
counts
of
attempting
to
conceal
a
homicide
.
Under
the
agreement
,
he
pleaded
guilty
to
one
count
of
first-degree
murder
and
the
remaining
counts
against
him
were
dropped
.
He
faced
up
to
natural
life
in
prison
if
the
case
would
have
gone
to
trial
.
On
Oct.
26
,
2013
,
Varner
killed
his
wife
with
a
machete
in
her
bedroom
in
an
Antioch
apartment
the
two
shared
.
He
then
suffocated
his
mother
two
days
later
,
according
to
authorities
.
Police
said
he
told
investigators
he
killed
his
wife
because
she
was
suffering
from
a
chronic
disease
,
and
killed
his
mother
after
he
feared
she
was
becoming
suspicious
about
his
wife
’
s
death
.
After
the
women
were
killed
,
police
said
Varner
stole
his
brother
’
s
van
and
drove
to
North
Dakota
,
where
he
was
arrested
after
he
burst
into
a
Catholic
mass
and
robbed
parishioners
at
gunpoint
.
He
was
returned
to
Lake
County
following
his
arrest
,
and
,
deemed
a
flight
risk
,
has
been
held
in
Lake
County
Jail
without
bail
.
He
is
expected
to
be
transferred
to
an
Illinois
Department
of
Corrections
facility
in
the
near
future
.

This
winter
storm
is
brewing
just
in
time
for
one
of
the
busiest
tra
vel
days
of
the
year
.
Airlines
estimate
4.2
million
people
are
passing
through
both
O'Hare
and
Midway
during
the
18
days
surrounding
the
holiday
season
.
Olney
Anthony
was
among
the
3.1
million
travelers
at
O'Hare
.
Anthony
says
the
lines
have
,
“
…been
fairly
short
.
I
came
out
of
Orlando
,
Florida
,
went
through
Charlotte
,
now
I
'm
here
in
Chicago
.
The
lines
have
been
,
fairly
,
fairly
light
.
''
The
TSA
says
their
goal
is
to
screen
passengers
in
20
minutes
or
less
nationwide
.
On
November
30
,
travelers
at
Midway
faced
long
lines
due
to
a
delayed
opening
at
a
checkpoint
.
``
We
were
thinking
it
's
going
to
be
crowded
,
but
it
is
okay
.
So
we
did
great
so
far
.
Very
excited
for
our
holidays
,
”
said
passenger
Shalini
Ragupathy
.
Unwrapped
presents
,
will
help
you
get
through
security
faster
.
``
If
you
bring
a
package
to
take
home
,
do
n't
wrap
it
.
It
might
get
unwrapped
at
the
security
checkpoint
,
but
we
have
free
gift
wrapping
,
just
past
security
in
both
airports
,
”
said
Karen
Pride
,
a
spokeswoman
with
the
Chicago
Department
of
Aviation
.
There
's
another
thing
the
airport
is
doing
to
brighten
the
holiday
season
for
travelers
.
``
We
have
live
entertainment
at
both
airports
between
1
and
4
p.m.
that
's
past
security
,
so
we
've
got
carolers
and
choirs
,
all
kinds
of
live
entertainment
,
musical
entertainment
,
''
Pride
said
.
With
the
weather
expected
to
take
a
turn
for
the
worse
on
Christmas
Eve
,
travelers
need
to
be
prepared
.
``
I
think
the
airlines
are
taking
a
very
close
look
at
it
as
well
as
we
are
at
the
airports
.
They
will
make
their
determinations
as
to
whether
they
're
going
to
cancel
flights
proactively
if
the
weather
gets
really
bad
in
certain
parts
of
the
country
,
or
not
,
”
Pride
said
.
American
Airlines
canceled
70
flights
for
Christmas
Eve
.
They
are
offering
a
waiver
to
allow
travelers
at
O
’
Hare
and
Midway
to
change
their
flights
for
free
.
The
TSA
recommends
getting
to
the
airport
90
minutes
early
.

When
you
're
on
Facebook
,
how
much
can
you
trust
your
supposed
``
frien
ds
”
?
2
Investigator
Pam
Zekman
found
a
group
of
women
who
say
they
were
ripped
off
when
buying
things
from
members
on
Facebook
.
They
say
they
were
solicited
on
private
Facebook
groups
,
so
they
thought
they
could
trust
the
seller
.
And
that
's
when
problems
started
.
Jennifer
Vestuto
sold
clothing
and
accessories
through
ads
she
posted
on
private
Facebook
groups
,
like
“
Moms
of
Oak
Lawn
.
”
Some
victims
thought
they
could
trust
her
because
she
said
she
was
a
working
mother
like
them
.
``
She
lives
in
our
neighborhood
,
I
never
thought
for
one
second
that
she
was
a
scam
artist
,
''
one
mother
,
Shontrese
Jackson
,
says
.
Another
mom
,
Sherri
Williams
,
says
:
“
I
think
she
is
supporting
her
family
by
ripping
people
off.
”
The
women
say
they
initially
trusted
Vestuto
because
she
posted
on
a
mom
’
s
page
where
many
of
them
share
recipes
,
order
and
sell
things
,
and
help
each
other
out
.
After
they
replied
to
Vestuto
’
s
Facebook
ads
,
she
invited
them
to
her
home
and
showed
them
sample
items
.
She
then
took
their
orders
offered
at
big
discounts
.
“
They
were
cheaper
than
what
you
can
afford
in
the
stores
,
and
I
have
four
kids
,
and
I
thought
it
would
be
a
great
Christmas
present
for
them
,
''
Williams
says
.
She
ordered
four
North
Face
jackets
and
paid
$
250
in
cash
up
front
.
Williams
says
she
was
promised
the
items
in
two
weeks
,
but
it
took
three
months
to
receive
them
.
“
There
was
always
a
new
excuse
.
The
order
did
n't
come
in
,
her
kids
were
sick
,
”
Williams
says
.
When
she
finally
did
receive
the
items
,
she
says
,
they
weren
’
t
what
she
had
ordered
.
She
ordered
one
men
’
s
large
jacket
,
a
small
pink
and
black
jacket
in
a
child
’
s
size
and
two
ladies
’
jackets
in
size
large
.
What
she
got
,
she
says
,
were
two
men
’
s
XXL
,
a
ladies
’
medium
jacket
,
and
another
jacket
that
she
believes
was
used
and
had
hair
all
over
it
.
``
I
said
,
‘
I
am
not
taking
these
items
,
this
is
not
what
I
ordered
,
’
”
Williams
says
.
“
I
've
asked
for
my
money
back
numerous
times
.
She
keeps
telling
me
no
,
there
are
no
refunds.
”
Jackson
says
she
had
problems
when
she
ordered
a
North
Face
jacket
from
Vestuto
for
$
60
.
When
it
didn
’
t
come
on
the
expected
date
,
she
says
she
got
similar
excuses
from
Vestuto
and
never
got
the
jacket
.
``
You
ca
n't
just
rip
people
off
,
”
Jackson
says
.
“
You
ca
n't
just
take
peoples
'
money
and
not
give
what
you
said
you
were
going
to
give
them
.
''
Zekman
tried
to
reach
Vestuto
at
her
home
,
but
she
didn
’
t
respond
.
However
,
her
husband
did
come
outside
during
one
CBS
2
visit
.
He
said
her
wife
only
sold
second-hand
baby
clothes
and
toys
online
and
her
customers
always
got
what
they
ordered
.
But
on
Facebook
there
are
ads
posted
by
Vestuto
for
jackets
,
shoes
,
handbags
and
more
.
Her
husband
also
said
the
people
complaining
did
not
order
anything
.
“
A
friend
on
Facebook
is
n't
really
a
friend
,
''
cautions
fraud
expert
William
Kresse
,
a
professor
at
Governors
State
University
.
“
You
think
this
person
wo
n't
harm
me
,
they
understand
me
,
they
're
just
like
me
.
They
may
be
nothing
like
you
,
and
they
're
doing
it
solely
to
get
into
your
money.
”
Kresse
says
consumers
have
to
be
alert
when
purchasing
on
Facebook
or
other
social
media
.
“
It
really
comes
down
to
you
:
You
have
to
be
cautious
,
you
have
to
be
vigilant
because
social
media
is
virtual
reality
,
it
’
s
not
reality
,
”
he
says
.
Williams
says
she
will
never
order
off
a
social
media
site
again
.
The
moms
CBS
2
interviewed
say
they
want
Vestuto
to
stop
selling
on
Facebook
but
don
’
t
know
where
to
turn
.
Williams
says
she
went
to
the
Oak
Lawn
Police
Department
to
file
a
report
,
but
was
told
that
this
was
a
civil
matter
and
she
would
have
to
file
a
lawsuit
.
Several
other
women
had
similar
complaints
.
But
there
have
also
been
positive
comments
on
Vestuto
's
website
indicating
some
customers
did
get
what
they
ordered
and
were
happy
with
the
items
.

**CHICAGO
(
CBS
)
--
**
The
family
of
a
young
black
man
shot
and
killed
by
Chicago
police
in
October
2014
has
repeated
their
demand
that
the
city
release
dashboard
camera
video
of
the
shooting
,
a
week
after
authorities
released
video
of
the
sh
ooting
death
of
17-year-old
Laquan
McDonald
.
Ronald
Johnson
,
25
,
was
shot
and
killed
eight
days
before
McDonald
,
but
his
death
has
not
received
the
same
public
attention
.
On
Tuesday
,
Johnson
’
s
mother
accused
the
Police
Department
of
covering
up
her
son
’
s
death
.
At
her
family
attorney
’
s
office
in
the
West
Loop
,
Dorothy
Holmes
said
the
video
of
her
son
’
s
death
will
show
he
was
unarmed
,
and
–
similar
to
McDonald
–
walking
away
from
police
,
not
toward
them
,
when
he
was
shot
.
She
said
an
autopsy
revealed
her
son
was
shot
in
the
back
on
Oct.
12
,
2014
.
Holmes
filed
a
federal
lawsuit
against
Officer
George
Hernandez
and
the
city
last
year
,
claiming
dashboard
camera
video
shows
Johnson
never
pointed
a
weapon
at
police
,
was
moving
away
from
Hernandez
,
and
was
not
an
imminent
threat
to
officers
when
he
was
shot
.
Police
have
said
Johnson
pulled
a
gun
during
a
chase
in
the
5400
block
of
South
King
Drive
,
after
officers
responded
to
a
call
of
shots
fired
one
block
away
.
Holmes
’
attorney
,
Michael
Oppenheimer
,
said
he
’
s
seen
the
video
of
the
shooting
,
and
“
I
’
m
100
percent
certain
Ronald
Johnson
had
nothing
in
his
hand.

“
The
dashcam
video
,
which
I
’
m
not
allowed
to
show
you
today
,
clearly
shows
that
he
was
not
carrying
a
weapon
,
nor
did
he
ever
turn
and
point
anything
.
The
police
department
planted
that
gun
,
”
Oppenheimer
said
.
“
We
believe
that
the
gun
was
planted
on
Ronald
Johnson
after
the
shooting.
”
Last
week
,
Holmes
called
on
the
mayor
,
Chicago
police
,
and
Cook
County
prosecutors
to
release
the
video
of
the
shooting
“
so
that
everybody
can
see
that
this
officer
is
lying
about
what
happened
on
that
night
when
he
murdered
my
son.
”
She
repeated
that
demand
Tuesday
,
saying
``
this
has
got
to
stop
.
''
The
city
has
fought
the
release
of
the
video
in
the
Johnson
case
,
just
as
it
did
in
the
McDonald
case
until
a
Cook
County
judge
ordered
the
city
to
make
that
video
public
.
“
They
are
still
seeking
to
hide
this
video
,
”
Oppenheimer
said
.
Holmes
said
her
lawsuit
against
the
city
is
not
about
money
.
“
It
’
s
still
dirty
money
.
It
’
s
not
going
to
bring
him
back
,
”
she
said
.
She
said
she
wants
Cook
County
State
’
s
Attorney
Anita
Alvarez
,
Mayor
Rahm
Emanuel
and
Police
Supt
.
Garry
McCarthy
–
[
who
was
fired
by
the
mayor
Tuesday
morning
]
[

]
–
“
to
see
how
would
they
feel
if
they
were
sitting
over
here
where
I
’
m
sitting
at
,
explaining
their
story
about
what
happened
to
one
of
their
kids
.
My
son
had
life
.
He
had
five
kids
,
ages
ranging
from
eight
to
two
.
My
son
’
s
supposed
to
be
here
,
he
’
s
not
supposed
to
be
over
at
Mount
Hope
Cemetery.
”
Johnson
’
s
family
also
has
asked
for
a
special
prosecutor
to
be
assigned
to
the
case
,
voicing
distrust
in
Alvarez
,
given
how
long
it
took
her
to
bring
charges
against
Officer
Jason
Van
Dyke
in
the
McDonald
case
.
Van
Dyke
was
not
charged
for
more
than
a
year
after
McDonald
was
killed
,
and
only
after
authorities
were
ordered
to
release
the
video
of
that
shooting
.
Johnson
’
s
family
has
been
waiting
longer
for
the
investigation
of
his
death
to
be
completed
.
Hernandez
has
been
placed
on
desk
duty
while
the
Independent
Police
Review
Authority
investigates
the
shooting

**CHICAGO
(
CBS
)
--
**
Four
Chicago
police
officers
helped
save
the
lives
of
three
men
in
the
Back
of
the
Yards
neighborhood
late
Monday
night
,
when
the
officers
pulled
the
victims
out
of
a
burning
car
.
Just
before
11
p.m.
,
a
Kia
was
speeding
west
in
the
700
block
of
West
Garfield
Boulevard
,
when
the
driver
lost
control
.
The
car
struck
a
tree
,
a
pole
,
and
the
fence
and
front
porch
of
a
brownstone
.
“
We
seen
a
car
traveling
at
a
high
rate
of
speed
,
at
which
point
it
crashed
into
a
tree
and
the
street
light
here
,
and
then
at
that
point
it
became
engulfed
in
flames
,
”
said
Officer
Ryan
Krolikowski
.
Krolikowski
and
his
partner
,
Eric
Wicencyjusz
,
rushed
over
and
pulled
three
young
men
out
of
the
car
as
it
caught
fire
.
Two
more
officers
,
Ivan
Romo
and
Mike
Bunyon
,
who
drove
up
to
the
scene
after
hearing
about
it
on
the
radio
,
helped
the
first
two
officers
.
The
men
inside
the
car
were
stuck
,
because
airbags
had
deployed
,
and
they
were
confined
under
their
seatbelts
.
The
officers
cut
their
seatbelts
to
get
them
out
.
Bunyon
said
it
was
like
“
something
out
of
a
movie.
”
“
You
see
these
poor
guys
trapped
in
the
car
,
and
you
’
ve
just
got
to
do
what
you
’
ve
got
to
do
.
You
’
ve
got
to
pull
them
out
,
and
luckily
we
had
seatbelt
cutters
,
and
all
that
stuff
handy
,
and
we
were
able
to
get
them
out
right
away
,
and
the
third
guy
we
were
able
to
pull
out
on
the
other
side
,
and
everything
panned
out
.
Hopefully
they
’
re
okay
,
”
he
said
.
The
victims
,
who
all
appeared
to
be
in
their
late
teens
,
were
taken
to
John
H.
Stroger
Jr.
Hospital
of
Cook
County
,
where
their
conditions
stabilized
.
No
one
in
the
home
was
injured
.
The
home
sustained
minor
damage
.
The
fence
and
stairs
took
the
brunt
of
the
damage
.
“
I
heard
a
big
boom
,
and
I
got
up
,
and
ran
out
and
looked
,
and
I
saw
the
car
in
the
yard
,
and
there
was
smoke
,
and
the
police
and
the
fire
department
both
were
just
absolute
angels
.
They
were
here
right
away
,
”
homeowner
Beverly
Ennis
said
.
The
homeowners
said
this
was
the
second
crash
outside
their
home
in
the
past
couple
years
.

Cook
County
sheriff
’
s
police
are
warning
northwest
suburban
reside
nts
about
a
string
of
“
ruse
”
burglaries
last
month
.
At
least
four
incidents
have
been
reported
in
unincorporated
Cook
County
in
which
burglars
pose
as
utility
workers
,
landscapers
or
new
neighbors
to
gain
access
to
someone
’
s
home
,
according
to
a
statement
from
the
sheriff
’
s
office
.
The
burglar
then
distracts
the
homeowners
,
who
are
often
elderly
,
while
a
partner
enters
the
home
and
takes
cash
and
valuables
.
The
most
recent
burglary
took
place
12:40
p.m.
Nov.
29
in
the
1000
block
of
Huber
Lane
in
unincorporated
Glenview
,
sheriff
’
s
police
said
.
Two
men
knocked
on
the
door
saying
they
were
doing
yard
work
for
a
neighbor
.
When
the
84-year-
old
resident
invited
one
of
the
men
into
her
house
for
a
glass
of
water
,
the
other
man
took
items
from
the
home
.
She
did
not
notice
they
were
missing
until
after
she
asked
them
to
leave
.
On
Nov.
12
,
a
man
knocked
on
the
door
about
3
p.m.
of
a
77-year-old
man
living
in
the
9000
block
of
North
Greenwood
in
unincorporated
Niles
offering
tree-
trimming
services
,
sheriff
’
s
police
said
.
When
the
suspect
began
to
talk
on
the
phone
in
another
language
,
the
victim
said
he
did
not
want
the
services
.
He
noticed
cash
missing
from
the
home
the
next
day
.
Similar
burglaries
have
been
reported
in
unincorporated
Palatine
and
Roselle
.
The
sheriff
’
s
office
encourages
residents
to
call
agencies
to
verify
employees
who
say
they
are
doing
work
at
their
homes
and
not
to
let
anyone
unexpected
into
the
house
.
Anyone
with
information
about
these
burglaries
should
call
the
Sheriff
’
s
Police
Investigation
Section
at
708-865-4896

COOK
COUNTY
CRIMINAL
COURTHOUSE
—
Three
men
have
been
charged
in
the
May
2015
murder
of
Sorrell
Marshall
.
Marshall
,
40
,
was
shot
five
times
in
his
groin
and
leg
during
an
armed
robbery
in
the
3700
block
of
South
Vincennes
Avenue
about
2
a.m.
May
1
,
2015
,
Assistant
State
's
Attorney
April
Gonzales
said
during
a
bond
hearing
Thursday
.
He
died
of
his
wounds
on
May
23
,
according
to
the
Cook
County
Medical
Examiner
's
Office
.
Three
men
—
Kamari
Belmont
,
22
,
Terrence
Hogan
,
22
,
and
Khalil
Powell
,
20
—
were
charged
this
week
with
first-degree
murder
.
It
's
not
clear
why
there
was
a
delay
in
filing
charges
.
According
to
prosecutors
,
the
trio
robbed
Marshall
and
a
20-year-old
woman
as
the
pair
walked
to
the
woman
's
Douglas
apartment
about
2
a.m.
May
1
.
Belmont
reached
into
the
woman
's
coat
pocket
without
her
permission
,
stealing
an
iPhone
,
charger
,
Old
Navy
credit
card
and
wallet
,
Gonzales
said
.
Hogan
,
meanwhile
,
allegedly
pointed
a
semiautomatic
gun
at
Marshall
.
When
Marshall
tried
to
sway
away
the
gun
,
prosecutors
said
,
Hogan
began
shooting
,
striking
Marshall
four
times
in
his
groin
.
According
to
Gonzales
,
Powell
drove
the
getaway
car
,
a
gray
four-door
sedan
.
At
one
point
,
Marshall
tried
to
throw
himself
on
the
hood
of
the
car
to
prevent
it
from
leaving
,
prosecutors
said
.
Marshall
eventually
fell
to
the
ground
,
and
Hogan
allegedly
shot
him
one
more
time
in
the
thigh
before
Hogan
,
Powell
and
Belmont
got
away
.
Marshall
was
taken
to
Stroger
Hospital
and
underwent
surgery
,
Gonzales
said
.
He
would
later
die
as
a
result
of
his
injuries
on
May
23
.
About
an
hour
after
the
shooting
,
Belmont
,
Hogan
and
Powell
robbed
two
more
people
at
gunpoint
in
the
South
Loop
,
prosecutors
said
.
The
attack
happened
in
the
first
block
of
East
21st
Street
,
about
two
miles
from
the
scene
of
the
fatal
shooting
.
Hogan
and
Belmont
again
approached
the
victims
while
Powell
waited
in
the
car
,
Gonzales
said
.
Belmont
pointed
a
gun
at
a
38-year-old
man
and
stole
a
wallet
and
cellphone
,
according
to
prosecutors
.
The
victim
's
37-year-old
companion
,
meanwhile
,
ran
away
screaming
and
was
eventually
able
to
flag
down
police
,
who
heard
a
commotion
.
Using
a
Find
My
iPhone
app
,
the
two
victims
in
the
South
Loop
robbery
were
able
to
direct
police
to
the
500
block
of
West
43rd
Street
,
Gonzales
said
.
Officers
found
Belmont
,
Hogan
and
Powell
still
sitting
inside
the
gray
sedan
.
When
the
trio
got
out
of
the
car
,
police
noticed
that
Belmont
had
a
gun
tucked
into
his
waistband
,
Gonazles
said
.
Belmont
allegedly
lunged
at
one
of
the
officers
,
who
fired
his
own
gun
,
striking
Belmont
in
the
arm
and
chest
area
,
she
added
.
Belmont
then
ran
off
,
prosecutors
said
,
dropping
behind
him
a
loaded
9-mm
handgun
with
an
extended
clip
with
a
30-round
capacity
.
The
gun
was
loaded
with
22
live
rounds
,
including
one
in
the
chamber
,
Gonzales
said
.
Ballistics
testing
would
later
reveal
that
the
gun
was
the
same
one
used
to
fatally
shoot
Marshall
,
according
to
authorities
.
Police
arrested
Hogan
and
Powell
on
the
scene
,
where
officers
recovered
a
cellphone
from
the
second
robbery
.
Police
arrested
Belmont
a
short
while
later
after
he
checked
himself
into
Mercy
Hospital
with
a
gunshot
wound
,
prosecutors
said
.
Cook
County
Judge
Donald
Panarese
Jr.
on
Thursday
set
Hogan
's
bail
at
$
2
million
and
Powell
's
bail
at
$
75,000
.
Belmont
is
expected
to
appear
before
the
judge
for

He
woke
his
two
roommates
and
they
left
through
the
front
doors
without
incident
,
he
said
.
But
for
at
least
four
other
residents
of
the
three-flat
,
escaping
was
not
so
easy
.
Firefighters
had
to
rescue
two
people

trapped
inside
a
unit
,
said
Cmdr
.
Frank
Velez

escape
the
flames
,
Velez
said

They
were
also
critically
wounded

he
said

``
It

to
Advocate
Illinois
Masonic
Medical
Center
,
Velez
said

Orlins
said
a
top-floor
apartment
's
floor

in
due
to
the
amount
of
water
trapped
inside

He
said
he
has
heard
that
the
building
can
be
salvaged
,
but
everyone

``
They
said
it
has

``
Everyone

his

sustained
soot
,
smoke
and
water
damage

that
he
was
able

salvage
a

at
about
10
a.m.
Friday
.
He
was
walking
some
of
his

other

a
nearby
dry
cleaner

Just

CHICAGO
(
WLS
)
--
A
16-year-old
boy
was
killed
and
an
18-year-old
man
was
critically
wounded
in
a
shooting
in
Chicago
's
Englewood
neighborhood
.
Police
said
the
two
teens
were
standing
outside
in
the
7
300-block
of
South
Sangamon
Street
around
4:45
p.m.
Monday
when
a
male
they
did
not
know
walked
up
to
them
,
opened
fire
and
ran
away
.
The
gunman
was
wearing
a
black
hooded
sweatshirt
.
The
16-year-old
boy
was
shot
in
the
head
.
He
died
at
the
scene
.
His
identity
has
not
been
released
.
The
18-year-old
man
was
shot
in
the
shoulder
.
He
was
transported
to
Advocate
Christ
Medical
Center
,
where
his
condition
stabilized
.
No
one
is
in
custody
.
Area
South
detectives
are
investigating
.

The
Cook
County
medical
examiner
's
office
said
two
boys
who
were
found
dead
in
2015
,
along
with
their
mother
and
youngest
sibling
,
died
of
smoke
inhalation
in
a
fire
that
was
set
at
their
East
Chatham
home
.
The
deaths
of
Andrew
Simms
Jr.
,
11
,
and
Kameron
Simms
,
10
,
have
been
ruled
homicides
by
the
office
.
It
took
more
than
eight
months
for
the
office
to
make
that
determination
because
the
complex
testing
,
that
included
DNA
testing
,
takes
up
to
a
year
to
complete
,
said
Becky
Schlikerman
,
a
spokeswoman
for
the
medical
examiner
's
office
.
There
was
no
update
on
the
case
available
from
police
Tuesday
.
The
boys
'
decomposing
bodies
,
along
with
their
mother
and
their
5-year-old
brother
,
were
discovered
inside
a
red
brick
house
in
the
8300
block
of
South
Drexel
Avenue
around
8:25
p.m.
on
July
18
.
There
was
evidence
of
a
fire
inside
the
home
,
but
officials
said
they
never
received
a
call
at
that
address
.
The
mother
,
Latoya
Jackson
,
28
,
appeared
to
have
suffered
head
trauma
and
had
burns
on
her
body
,
authorities
said
.
It
was
later
determined
she
died
of
strangulation
and
her
death
was
ruled
a
homicide
,
according
to
the
medical
examiner
's
office
.
The
cause
of
death
of
the
5-year-old
,
Kantrell
Williams
,
was
probable
inhalation
of
products
of
combustion
in
an
incendiary
fire
,
and
his
death
was
ruled
a
homicide
.
The
medical
examiner
's
office
said
Tuesday
that
Andrew
Simms
Jr.
also
died
of
probable
inhalation
of
products
of
combustion
in
an
incendiary
fire
.
Kameron
Simms
,
it
said
,
died
of
carbon
monoxide
toxicity
and
inhalation
of
products
of
combustion
in
an
incendiary
fire
.
The
family
of
four
had
recently
moved
to
the
Drexel
Avenue
address
after
leaving
their
longtime
home
about
a
mile
east
,
relatives
said
.

COUNTY
CRIMINAL
COURTHOUSE
—
Prosecutors
say
a
bizarre
spat
between
two
Manny
's
Deli
workers
started
when
one
pushed
the
other
while
he
was
loading
hot
gelatin
into
a
fridge
—
and
ended
with
part
of
an
ear
being
bitten
off
.
``
Let
's
go
,
Tyson
,
''
a
Cook
County
sheriff
's
deputy
said
to
the
alleged
ear
biter
as
he
led
him
out
of
court
Wednesday
,
referring
to
boxer
Mike
Tyson
's
notorious
chomping
of
Evander
Holyfield
's
ears
.
The
53-year-old
victim
now
hears
constant
ringing
and
is
``
permanently
disfigured
,
''
since
doctors
were
n't
able
to
reattach
the
earlobe
,
Assistant
State
's
Attorney
Erin
Antonietti
said
during
a
bond
hearing
Wednesday
.
Sergio
Sanchez
,
45
,
and
the
victim
work
together
at
Manny
's
Deli
at
1141
S.
Jefferson
St
.
,
prosecutors
said
.
Earlier
this
month
,
Sanchez
allegedly
``
pushed
into
''
his
co-worker
as
the
man
was
trying
to
load
a
container
of
hot
Jell-O
into
a
refrigerator
,
Antonietti
said
.
A
few
days
later
,
on
April
18
,
Sanchez
approached
the
victim
as
he
walked
to
work
in
the
1300
block
of
South
Jefferson
Street
,
demanding
to
``
finish
their
argument
,
''
according
to
Antonietti
.
Sanchez
took
off
his
belt
and
proceeded
to
whip
the
victim
,
prosecutors
said
.
He
then
bit
the
victim
's
ear
,
ripping
off
part
of
the
man
's
earlobe
,
court
records
show
.
``
The
victim
saw
a
part
of
his
ear
in
[
Sanchez
's
]
mouth
,
''
Antonietti
said
in
court
Wednesday
.
Both
men
then
went
to
work
,
prosecutors
said
,
and
the
victim
was
eventually
taken
to
a
nearby
hospital
.
According
to
Antonietti
,
the
man
needed
two
stitches
in
his
temple
and
will
need
``
more
medical
follow-up
''
for
his
ear
injury
.
Sanchez
,
of
the
5900
block
of
South
Mozart
Street
,
was
charged
with
aggravated
battery
causing
great
bodily
harm
.
Sanchez
is
married
with
children
and
has
worked
in
catering
for
five
years
,
his
public
defender
said
.
Cook
County
Judge
Donald
Panarese
Jr.
on
Wednesday
said
Sanchez
could
be
released
on
electronic
monitoring
so
long
as
he
qualifies
for
the
Cook
County
Sheriff
's
Office
's
monitoring
program
.
If
not
,
bail
for
Sanchez
would
be
set
at
$
100,000
.
If
he
's
released
,
Sanchez
would
not
allowed
to
contact
the
victim
or
go
back
to
work
at
Manny
's

the
judge
ordered

shot
him
,
reported
TV
station
Fox
4
News
.
Then
Bradden
called
his
father
,
who
advised
his
son
to
pull
over
and
wait
for
him
,
Fox
reported
.
Police
said
the
two
then
drove
to
a
Texas
Department
of
Public
Safety
station
in
Hill
County
where
the
22-year-old
turned
himself
in
.
The
initial
altercation
that
turned
the
morning
bloody
began
as
a
spat
between
Bradden
and
his
wife
,
Quinisha
Johnson
,
an
employee
at
the
Walgreens
,
reported
the
Dallas
Morning
News
.
The
couple
was
arguing
outside
the
store
when
Bradden
pulled
out
his
gun
and
fired
it
twice
at
his
wife
's
feet
,
striking
her
once
in
the
ankle
,
according
to
reports
.
Johnson
told
police
she
fled
inside
,
shouting
for
help
,
reported
the
Dallas
Morning
News
.
She
was
recovering
at
a
local
hospital
Monday
with
injuries
considered
to
be
non
life-threatening
,
police
said
.
As
word
of
the
altercation
spread
throughout
Arlington
,
family
and
friends
gathered
at
CrossFit
Abattoir
,
the
gym
T.J.
Antell
owned
with
his
wife
,
Crystal
.
``
He
went
into
protective
mode
.
He
's
a
father
,
he
's
protective
by
nature
,
''
Antell
's
pastor
,
Marc
Lowrance
,
told
reporters
Monday
.
``
And
he
thought
he
could
help
everyone
involved
,
and
tragically
it
went
a
different
way
.
''
Antell
,
Lowrance
said
,
``
sacrificed
himself
for
this
family
,
much
the
way
he
sacrificed
himself
for
strangers
today
.
''
Police
spent
most
of
the
day
interviewing
witnesses
.
When
asked
if
Antell
should
have
intervened
,
Arlington
police
spokesman
Christopher
Cook
told
the
Dallas
Morning
News
there
's
no
clear
cut
answer
.
``
Without
having
all
the
details
,
it
would
be
inappropriate
for
me
to
speculate
,
''
he
said
.
In
an
interview
with
TV
station
NBC
5
,
Cook
offered
this
advice
:
``
Anytime
you
can
be
the
best
witness
you
can
be
,
we
always
recommend
that
.
''
As
the
number
of
states
allowing
people
to
carry
guns
has
increased
,
reports
of
injuries
and
deaths
have
also
risen
.
Just
last
week
,
a
churchgoer
in
Pennsylvania
--
in
possession
of
a
concealed
carry
permit
and
a
some
sort
of
badge
to
prove
it
--
intervened
in
an
already
settled
spat
between
congregation
members
over
reserved
church
seating
.
The
man
,
Mark
Storms
,
approached
Robert
Braxton
,
showed
him
a
gun
on
his
belt
and
a
gold
badge
,
then
asked
him
to
leave
,
reported
the
Associated
Press
.
Braxton
threw
a
punch
,
then
Storms
fired
two
shots
,
killing
the
man
.
Storms
was
charged
with
voluntary
manslaughter
,
the
AP
reported
.
Last
fall
,
a
Detroit
woman
with
a
concealed
carry
permit
fired
at
a
fleeing
shoplifter
outside
a
[
Home
Depot
]
[
2
]
.
She
was
later
sentenced
to
18
months
of
probation
and
stripped
of
her
concealed
gun
permit
.
She
told
a
TV
station
that
she
``
will
never
help
anybody
again
.
''
Around
that
same
time
,
a
customer
at
a
Southside
Chicago
bodega
fired
at
a
robbery
suspect
wearing
a
mask
and
brandishing
what
looked
like
a
real
gun
.
It
was
n't
,
but
the
shots
fired
by
the
customer
,
a
concealed
carry
permit
holder
,
killed
the
robbery
suspect
.
Soon
after
,
police
announced
that
charges
against
the
customer
were
unlikely
.
On
Monday
,
a
new
Tennessee
law
was
passed
allowing
full-time
employees
at
the
state
's
public
colleges
and
universities
to
carry
handguns
on
campus
.
Since
2007
,
the
number
of
Americans
holding
concealed
carry
permits
has
nearly
tripled
,
rising
from
4.6
million
to
12.8
million
in
2015
.

Gia
.
Though
Perez
initially
denied
killing
Gia
,
a
medium-sized
mixed-breed
dog
,
he
later
apologized
to
his
girlfriend
via
text
,
Assistant
State
's
Attorney
Lorraine
Scaduto
said
during
a
bond
hearing
Tuesday
.
When
police
searched
Perez
's
house
last
week
,
they
found
another
dog
that
appeared
to
be

n't

Perez
's
defense
attorney
in
court
Tuesday
said
Perez
had
veterinary
bills
that
could
prove
he
had
n't
abused
that
dog
.
On
April
22
,
Perez
went
to
visit
his
girlfriend
at
her
home
in
the
3700
block
of
South
Damen
Avenue
in
McKinley
Park
,
and
became
angry
when
she
was
n't
there
,
prosecutors
said
.
The
home
was
``
secured
but
unlocked
,
''
according
to
Scaduto
,
and
Perez
left
himself
in
.
That
's
when
he
allegedly
kicked
Gia
multiple
times
before
throwing
her
down
a
flight
of
15
stairs
.
Perez
then
left
his
girlfriend
's
house
,
locking
the
door
behind
him
,
Scaduto
said
.
When
the
girlfriend
arrived
home
,
she
found
her
dead
dog
and
several
blood
spatters
,
prosecutors
said
.
According
to
authorities
,
the
dog
died
of
blunt
force
trauma
.
The
woman
immediately
confronted
Perez
,
who
denied
the
attack
,
according
to
prosecutors
.
When
she
confronted
him
again
on
the
phone
May
2
,
Perez
confessed
to
killing
the
dog
and
later
texted
an
apology
,
Scaduto
said
.
Perez
,
of
the
2300
block
of
North
Latrobe
Avenue
,
is
charged
with
aggravated
cruelty
to
animals
and
animal

He
has
prior
convictions
for
retail
theft
,
battery
,
criminal
damage
to
property
and
driving
on
a
suspended
or
revoked
license
,
prosecutors
said
.
According
to
his
defense
attorney
,
Perez
is
a
college
graduate
who
works
full
time
.
Court
records
list
Perez
as
a
construction
worker
.
Cook

NOBLE
SQUARE
—
Those
living
on
a
typically-quiet
Noble
Square
block
were
shaken
up
Tuesday
and
weighing
their
options
after
a
shooting
left
one
man
dead
and
two
others
wounded
late
Monday
.
Around
11:10
p.m.
,
three
men
were
standing
on
the
sidewalk
in
the
1500
block
of
West
Walton
Street
when
another
man
walked
up
and
shot
at
them
,
according
to
Officer
Jose
Estrada
,
a
Chicago
Police
spokesman
.
A
26-year-old
man
,
who
police
say
was
a
documented
gang
member
,
was
pronounced
dead
on
scene
after
being
shot
in
his
chest
.
The
Cook
County
Medical
Examiner
's
Office
identified
the
man
as
Eric
Nieves
,
of
the
900
block
of
North
Kedvale
Avenue
.
Around
7:30
a.m.
Tuesday
,
Demaris
Rivera
,
28
,
who
lives
a
few
doors
north
of
where
the
shooting
took
place
,
was
returning
home
after
dropping
her
two
children
off
at
school
.
Rivera
said
she
heard
gunshots
while
she
was
watching
television
.
``
I
checked
on
the
kids
and
10
minutes
later
,
the
body
was
in
middle
of
the
street
.
They
put
up
the
red
tape
up
right
away
,
''
Rivera
said
.
Though
her
children
,
age
12
and
7
,
slept
through
the
commotion
,
Rivera
said
herself
and
several
neighbors
gathered
outside
after
the
incident
.
``
For
the
most
part
it
's
quiet
[
on
this
street
]
.
I
was
broken
into
once
after
I
moved
in
about
a
year
and
a
half
ago
and
heard
gunshots
two
months
ago
but
that
's
it
.
My
husband
is
thinking
of
moving
to
Iowa
for
a
job
.
We
were
n't
thinking
about
the
safety
[
as
being
a
reason
to
leave
]
,
but
I
want
to
leave
,
''
Rivera
said
.
Kristin
McWilliams
,
a
25-year-old
marketing
representative
who
also
lives

to
head
to
work
Tuesday
,
just
a
few
feet
from
where
rain
had
washed
away
bloodstains
.
McWilliams
,
who
previously
lived
in
the
Gold
Coast
,
said
she
moved
to
Noble
Square
in
February
because
the
rent
is
much
cheaper
and
it
's
easier
to
find
parking
.
At
the
time
of
the
shootings
,
McWilliams
said
she
was
talking
with
her
boyfriend
on
the
phone
.
``
He
was
like
'Oh
my
,
God
,
those
are
gunshots
.
'
I
looked
outside
and
people
were
everywhere
,
''
McWilliams
said
.
McWilliams
also
said
the
street
is
usually
quiet
.
``
I
was
scared
last
night
but
I
'll
get
through
it
.
It
was
crazy
,
''
McWilliams
said
.
Peter
Gariepy
and
his
wife
were
still
awake
and
getting
their
8-week-old
daughter
ready
for
bed
when
they
heard
five
gunshots
.
Gariepy
said
police
told
them
the
incident
was
related
to
an
argument
among
gang
members
,
and
asked
if
anyone
had
heard
a
dispute
prior
to
the
shootings
.
For
neighbors
interested
in

there

CHICAGO
—
Police
say
at
least
six
cars
have
been
stolen
since
the
end
of
February
on
the
Near
West
Side
,
including
several
that
were
left
with
restaurant
valets
.
Police
say
cars
have
been
targeted
outside
of
City
Winery
,
Alahambra
Palace
,
and
a
nearby
car
wash.
Workers
at
the
car
wash
say
a
car
was
taken
while
it
was
being
dried
off
Monday
.
Photos
taken
from
security
cameras
show
a
young
black
male
in
a
hoodie
walking
down
Randolph
before
,
neighbors
say
,
he
approaches
a
Dodge
Durango
down
the
street
.
Pretending
like
he
’
s
talking
on
his
phone
,
he
gets
into
the
car
and
drives
it
away
.
Neighbors
say
they
have
asked
police
to
step
up
patrols
,
especially
in
the
evening
when
the
area
is
busiest
.
Most
of
these
cars
were
stolen
around
7
p.m.
,
police
say
,
right
when
people
are
heading
to
dinner
.
“
At
night
there
’
s
a
lot
of
foot
traffic
here
and
right
in
between
these
two
facilities
,
the
winery
and
Alahambra
,
they
have
a
lot
of
late
night
concerts
and
parties
so
there
is
a
lot
of
street
traffic
,
a
lot
of
valet
parking
.
I
mean
there
could
be
a
thousand
people
out
here
sometimes
at
night
,
”
said
Tom
Schuster
,
who
works
nearby
at
New
Dairy
.
An
investigation
is
underway

The
Associated
Press
VIENNA
--
A
southern
Illinois
prison
has
started
a
program
to
provide
inmates
who
are
being
released
with
new
clothes
.
The
idea
is
to
help
inmates
blend
in
once
they
're
released
,
instead
of
being
easily
identifiable
in
prison-issued
clothing
.
Darius
Saddler
will
be
released
from
Vienna
Correctional
Center
April
7
after
a
five-year
prison
sentence
related
to
drugs
.
He
tells
The
(
Carbondale
)
Southern
Illinoisan
he
has
a
polo
shirt
and
khaki
pants
picked
out
.
He
says
it
'll
make
him
feel
part
of
society
and
give
him
a
self-esteem
boost
,
which
he
'll
need
to
transition
back
into
society
.
Roughly
20
men
are
released
from
the
prison
each
week
.
Dylan
Luce
is
an
associate
warden
.
He
started
the
program
a
few
weeks
ago
.
It
's
called
Vienna
's
Clothing
Closet
with
over
500
donated
clothing
items

\-
A

immigration
agent
shot
an
unarmed

for
no
apparent
reason
as
the
man
answered
the
door
at
his
Chicago
home
,
a
lawyer
for
the
wounded
man
said
.
U.S.
Immigration
and
Customs

said
the
special
agent
was
attempting
to
arrest
someone
Monday
morning
when
a
second
person
pointed
a
weapon
at
agents
.
ICE
officials
said
the
special

fired
his
weapon
,
wounding
the
second
person
.
But
attorney
Thomas
Hallock
told
reporters
later
Monday
that
he
heard
a
different
version
of
events
when
he
visited
the
wounded
53-year-old
man
at
a
hospital
.
Hallock
said
he
was
told
the
man
heard
a
pounding
at
his
door
,
answered
it
and
was
shot
``
without
cause
.
''
Hallock
says
the
man
was
not
armed
.
``
I
do
n't
know
if
there
was
some
sort
of
mistake
,
''
Hallock
said
.
ICE
officials
said
Monday
its
Office
of
Professional
Responsibility
will
review
the
shooting
.
Asked
about
the
lawyer
's
account
of
the
shooting

Carl
Rusnok
said
in
an
email
Tuesday
that
the
investigation
is
ongoing
and
that
no
further
details
can
be

Hallock

the
man
and
his
wife
arrived
from
Mexico
more
than
two
decades
ago
and
are
legal
residents
of
the
United
States
.
Seven
or
eight
people
were
in
the
home
at
the
time
of
the
shooting
,
he
said
.
The
agency
has
not
publicly
named
the
target
of
the
arrest
warrant
and
it
was
n't
clear
if
that
person
was
detained
.
Hallock
said
he
is
also
representing
the
wounded
man
's
23-year-old
son
,
who
was
briefly
detained
.
Chicago
police
officials
said
their

responded

of
shots
fired

They
said
they
are
investigating
any
underlying
criminal

The
discovery
of
8-year-old
Gizzell
Ford
's
tortured
body
in
a
trash-strewn
Chicago
apartment
set
off
a
firestorm
of
shock
,
disgust
and
demands
for
change
.
Months
after
a
judge
ruled
against
the
child
's
mother
and
placed
Gizzell
in
her
grandmother
's
home
with
her
bedridden
father
,
the
straight-A
student
suffered
horrific
abuse
while
tied
to
a
bedpost
for
days
at
a
time
,
was
denied
food
and
water
,
and
punished
for
trying
to
take
a
sip
from
the
toilet
.
Gizzell
,
though
,
did
not
simply
fall
through
the
cracks
—
a
Chicago
Tribune
investigation
following
her
slaying
in
2013
found
that
multiple
layers
of
trained
professionals
duty-bound
to
protect
children
had
contact
with
the
emaciated
girl
in
the
final
months
of
her
life
but
failed
to
act
on
warning
signs
.
Now
,
as
the
child
's
grandmother
,
Helen
Ford
,
awaits
sentencing
following
her
recent
conviction
for
first-degree
murder
,
promises
of
systemic
reforms
in
Gizzell
's
memory
have
fallen
woefully
short
despite
some
incremental
improvements
in
training
and
collaboration
among
child
welfare
agencies
.
At
the
grandmother
's
trial
,
prosecutors
revealed
for
the
first
time
excerpts
from
the
rainbow-striped
journal
Gizzell
kept
over
the
summer
of
2013
as
she
endured
weeks
of
abuse
.
The
tone
,
once
hopeful
,
turned
dark
near
the
end
.
Gizzell
,
looking
forward
to
fourth
grade
,
wrote
that
she
was
``
a
beautiful
smart
and
good
young
lady
''
who
would
try
her
best
not
to
get
into
trouble
and
face
further
punishment
.
``
I
hate
this
life
because
now
I
'm
in
super
big
trouble
,
''
she
wrote
just
one
day
before
her
death
,
as
her
resiliency
finally
crumbled
amid
the
onslaught
of
verbal
,
emotional
and
physical
abuse
.
Attorneys
on
both
sides
of
the
case
agreed
on
this
much
—
that
a
Cook
County
domestic
relations
judge
should
never
have
placed
Gizzell
with
her
father
and
paternal
grandmother
,
both
unemployed
,
with
a
felony
conviction
in
each
of
their
backgrounds
.
Prosecutors
called
the
judge
's
ruling
``
a
disgrace
,
''
while
Ford
's
assistant
public
defenders
said
the
55-year-old
woman
was
overwhelmed
while
also
caring
for
her
quadriplegic
adult
son
and
two
young
grandsons
.
But
the
judge
was
far
from
the
only
one
who
missed
red
flags
,
interviews
and
records
obtained
by
the
Tribune
show
.
Barely
a
month
before
Gizzell
's
death
on
July
12
,
2013
,
an
investigator
for
the
Illinois
Department
of
Children
and
Family
Services
visited
the
grandmother
's
cockroach-infested
apartment
on
the
city
's
West
Side
as
she
checked
out
the
Fords
'
allegations
that
the
child
had
been
molested
by
her
mother
's
boyfriend
before
she
came
to
live
with
them
.
Prosecutors
said
bruises
and
wounds
over
her
entire
body
pointed
to
her
being
brutalized
for
weeks
,
but
the
DCFS
worker
reported
nothing
out
of
the
ordinary
beyond
a
cluttered
home
,
records
show
.
In
addition
,
a
respected
child-abuse
pediatrician
who
examined
Gizzell
for
the
possible
sexual
trauma
weeks
before
she
died
did
n't
call
the
DCFS
hotline
about
an
``
old
,
healing
loop
''
he
noted
on
the
girl
that
might
have
been
a
telltale
sign
of
abuse
.
The
doctor
also
may
not
have
followed
standard
protocol
in
cases
of
suspected
child
abuse
by
failing
to
question
Gizzell
privately
about
the
mark
outside
her
grandmother
's
presence
,
according
to
the
DCFS
Office
of
the
Inspector
General
.
Unable
to
find
evidence
of
sexual
trauma
,
he
characterized
the
exam
as
``
normal
''
but
noted
the
injury
and
two
other
marks
on
Gizzell
.
The
DCFS
investigator
had
access
to
the
physician
's
report
,
but
she
failed
to
act
as
well
.
Later
,
her
failures
in
Gizzell
's
care
led
to
her
firing
,
but
no
action
was
ever
taken
against
the
pediatrician
.
He
is
being
sued
,
however
,
by
Gizzell
's
mother
.
Equally
confounding
,
Gizzell
's
medical
exam
was
conducted
at
a
Children
's
Advocacy
Center
meant
to
provide
an
interdisciplinary
and
integrated
approach
to
child
abuse
allegations
,
yet
repeated
opportunities
for
collaboration
among
its
staff
,
the
pediatrician
and
DCFS
were
missed
.
News
of
Gizzell
's
suffering
outraged
state
and
local
officials
,
sparking
multiple
investigations
and
calls
for
action
that
for
the
most
part
have
produced
little
substantive
reform
.
For
instance
,
domestic
relations
judges
hearing
child
custody
disputes
between
impoverished
parents
who
ca
n't
afford
attorneys
still
are
forced
to
make
life-
or-death
decisions
with
few
resources
to
guide
them
.
And
DCFS
and
other
agencies
involved
in
child
welfare
still
often
operate
in
isolation
,
creating
communication
barriers
,
experts
say
.
DCFS
Director
George
Sheldon
,
hired
about
1
1/2
years
after
Gizzell
's
death
,
said
his
agency
``
should
have
seen
more
of
the
warning
signs
and
looked
deeper
,
with
a
greater
sense
of
urgency
about
the
risks
to
this
child
.
''
``
Regrettably
,
and
I
've
seen
this
too
many
times
,
everyone
failed
—
the
agency
,
the
doctor
,
the
courts
,
''
he
said
.
Sheldon
said
DCFS
is
making
progress
since
Gizzell
's
death
,
citing
innovations
in
technology
to
better
spot
red
flags
,
improved
training
and
pilot
projects
across
the
state
designed
to
localize
decision-making
and
shorten
how
long
kids
in
protective
custody
spend
in
temporary
placements
.
``
But
(
progress
)
is
slower
and
has
taken
more
time
than
anyone
would
hope
,
''
he
said
.
**
An
'agonizing
death
'
**
Even
veteran
Chicago
police
officers
were
stunned
at
the
condition
of
the
two-
bedroom
apartment
in
the
5200
block
of
West
Adams
Street
.
They
documented
the
squalor
in
their
reports
:
Cockroaches
scurried
across
the
floors
and
walls
.
The
rooms
were
so
cluttered
with
clothes
and
garbage
that
police
said
they
had
to
clear
a
path
just
to
walk
,
and
the
carpet
was
so
wet
and
filthy
that
it
felt
``
mushy
''
with
each
step
.
The
smell
of
urine
permeated
the
air
.
``
I
would
not
leave
a
rat
in
that
home
,
''
one
DCFS
document
reviewed
by
the
Tribune
quoted
Chicago
police
Sgt
.
Bryan
Holy
as
saying
.
Not
even
decades
of
experience
prepared
emergency
responders
for
what
they
discovered
in
one
of
the
bedrooms
.
Gizzell
's
strangled
and
badly
beaten
body
,
clad
only
in
torn
green
underwear
,
was
found
on
the
floor
of
her
father
's
room
.
Her
journal
lay
nearby
.
Its
last
entry
was
dated
one
day
earlier
,
July
11
,
but
authorities
said
much
of
the
girl
's
once-neat
writing
was
barely
legible
.
Authorities
said
the
70-pound
child
had
been
beaten
literally
from
head
to
toe
by
a
275-pound
grandmother
who
sometimes
wore
a
belt
around
her
neck
that
she
used
for
punishment
.
The
girl
's
father
,
Andre
Ford
,
bedridden
with
chronic
scleroderma
,
also
was
charged
in
the
slaying
,
but
he
died
before
trial
in
Cook
County
Jail
of
an
apparent
heart
attack
at
age
29
.
An
open
,
maggot-infested
wound
found
on
the
back
of
Gizzell
's
head
is
believed
to
have
been
caused
by
her
rubbing
against
a
metal
post
when
she
was
tied
to
her
father
's
bed
.
Her
wrists
and
ankles
had
visible
ligature
marks
.
Authorities
said
Gizzell
was
kept
there
as
a
virtual
prisoner
after
school
ended
in
mid-June
.
The
wounds
were
so
severe
that
a
Chicago
police
forensic
investigator
with
30
years
on
the
job
wept
from
the
witness
stand
at
the
grandmother
's
trial
as
she
looked
at
Gizzell
's
photo
.
Prosecutors
also
played
cellphone
videos
showing
the
Fords
berating
Gizzell
for
breaking
rules
as
the
terrified
girl
was
forced
to
stand
with
a
sock
or
rag
stuffed
in
her
mouth
.
In
convicting
Helen
Ford
of
first-degree
murder
,
Judge
Evelyn
Clay
found
overwhelming
evidence
that
the
killing
was
``
exceptionally
brutal
''
and
that
Gizzell
was
tortured
,
decisions
that
ensured
the
grandmother
faces
up
to
natural
life
in
prison
.
``
That
child
suffered
a
slow
and
agonizing
death
,
''
Clay
said
.
``
That
little
body
looked
like
it
had
been
pulverized
from
head
to
toe
.
''
How
Gizzell
ended
up
with
the
Fords
is
a
haunting
question
that
exposes
an
ugly
truth
about
inequities
in
domestic
relations
court
for
the
poorest
of
children
.
**
Adept
at
working
system
**
They
called
her
``
Beba
,
''
or
baby
girl
.
Gizzell
had
lived
most
of
her
life
with
her
mother
,
Sandra
Mercado
,
in
her
maternal
grandparents
'
home
in
Melrose
Park
.
Kathryn
Wanicek
taught
Gizzell
in
first
and
part
of
second
grades
.
She
never
met
the
Fords
but
recalls
Gizzell
's
mother
and
maternal
grandfather
,
Juan
Mercado
,
as
the
ones
who
came
to
school
.
Wanicek
thought
the
single
mother
was
doing
a
good
job
.
The
teacher
said
Gizzell
,
a
talented
,
inquisitive
child
,
came
to
school
each
morning
excited
to
learn
.
``
She
was
a
great
learner
and
loved
to
read
and
write
,
''
said
Wanicek
,
who
still
has
a
little
handwritten
note
from
the
girl
in
which
she
told
her
teacher
of
her
love
for
her
and
learning
.
``
Gizzell
was
always
someone
who
could
find
a
bright
spot
in
the
day
,
and
she
would
encourage
the
other
students
to
do
the
same
.
There
was
n't
a
day
that
she
came
to
school
sad
.
``
She
would
always
say
,
'What
are
we
doing
today
?
'
''
Sandra
Mercado
had
met
Andre
Ford
while
working
for
a
time
with
his
mother
.
Their
two-year
dating
relationship
ended
in
2004
—
the
year
Gizzell
was
born
.
Mercado
long
resisted
Andre
Ford
's
efforts
to
be
involved
in
their
daughter
's
life
,
according
to
court
records
.
Gizzell
's
father
petitioned
Cook
County
's
domestic
relations
court
for
shared
custody
in
June
2010
.
Mercado
fought
back
.
``
I
have
taken
care
of
my
little
girl
on
my
own
for
6
years
with
no
help
from
her
father
,
''
she
wrote
in
a
court
filing
.
``
Her
father
has
n't
done
anything
for
her
and
has
been
in
and
out
of
her
life
since
birth
.
''
Mercado
won
custody
of
Gizzell
,
but
the
dispute
continued
over
the
next
two
years
,
mostly
with
the
two
arguing
over
the
mother
's
compliance
with
the
father
's
visitation
.
In
November
2012
,
though
,
Andre
Ford
raised
more
serious
allegations
against
Mercado
while
seeking
emergency
custody
of
their
daughter
.
Misspelling
his
daughter
's
name
in
the
court
petition
,
he
alleged
that
Mercado
had
n't
let
him
see
Gizzell
for
a
year
,
but
that
he
had
heard
her
mother
was
homeless
,
wandering
the
streets
at
night
with
Gizzell
and
an
infant
sibling
,
court
records
show
.
The
next
day
,
Judge
Lionel
Jean-Baptiste
—
the
eighth
judge
whose
name
appears
in
paperwork
in
the
contested
custody
case
—
granted
the
father
temporary
custody
based
on
these
claims
and
that
Mercado
might
be
moving
out
of
state
.
Denying
the
allegations
,
Mercado
immediately
filed
for
the
return
of
Gizzell
.
While
trying
to
sort
out
the
dispute
,
the
judge
ordered
an
emergency
intervention
that
experts
say
indicates
concern
a
child
might
be
in
imminent
danger
.
As
part
of
that
process
,
a
court
expert
interviewed
both
parents
,
Helen
Ford
and
Gizzell
.
But
domestic
relations
judges
presiding
over
private
disputes
between
parents
concerning
custody
and
child
support
do
not
have
access
to
the
same
experts
or
legal
resources
as
in
child-protection
courtrooms
in
cases
in
which
the
state
has
taken
a
child
into
protective
custody
.
DCFS
and
lawyers
with
the
state
's
attorney
or
public
guardian
's
offices
are
not
regularly
assigned
to
these
courtrooms
,
for
instance
.
As
a
result
,
it
's
unclear
what
Jean-Baptiste
knew
about
the
work
,
family
,
mental
and
criminal
backgrounds
of
Helen
and
Andre
Ford
who
,
respectively
,
had
1985
forgery
and
2002
attempted
robbery
convictions
in
their
pasts
.
But
,
as
prosecutors
later
noted
,
the
grandmother
was
adept
at
working
the
levers
of
the
court
.
**
A
question
of
money
**
At
a
December
2012
custody
hearing
,
Jean-Baptiste
followed
the
recommendation
of
an
intervention
expert
that
Gizzell
remain
with
the
Fords
.
The
court
found
Gizzell
``
is
now
safe
and
comfortable
at
the
home
of
''
the
Fords
and
that
the
mother
had
been
in
and
out
of
at
least
four
homes
in
a
year
.
Gizzell
also
said
when
interviewed
that
she
wanted
to
remain
with
the
Fords
.
Sandra
Mercado
was
granted
supervised
visitation
twice
a
week
and
ordered
to
undergo
a
psychological
evaluation
and
parenting
classes
.
Months
later
,
in
July
2013
,
Gizzell
was
killed
just
a
couple
weeks
shy
of
her
ninth
birthday
.
The
Mercados
said
they
had
last
seen
her
in
April
,
blaming
the
Fords
for
blocking
visits
.
Juan
Mercado
,
Gizzell
's
maternal
grandfather
,
has
told
the
Tribune
that
he
was
present
at
court
and
denied
a
chance
to
be
interviewed
or
tell
the
judge
that
his
daughter
was
not
homeless
and
that
she
and
Gizzell
had
lived
with
him
until
recently
in
Melrose
Park
.
Though
he
was
not
required
to
do
so
,
Jean-Baptiste
could
have
appointed
a
legal
advocate
to
represent
Gizzell
's
interests
in
court
and
conduct
a
more
thorough
evaluation
of
medical
,
school
and
family
records
,
or
even
a
study
of
her
home
life
.
Such
discretionary
services
,
however
,
can
take
months
to
conclude
because
of
case
backlogs
,
according
to
experts
.
Jean-Baptiste
declined
to
comment
for
this
story
,
but
attorneys
familiar
with
his
courtroom
have
described
him
as
a
judge
who
is
fair
and
cares
about
doing
what
's
in
a
child
's
best
interest
.
Attorney
Stacey
Platt
,
associate
director
of
the
Civitas
ChildLaw
Clinic
at
Loyola
University
Chicago
School
of
Law
,
said
it
's
a
complicated
area
of
law
and
that
many
parents
without
the
financial
means
such
as
Gizzell
's
mom
end
up
representing
themselves
.
``
The
issues
before
the
family
court
,
like
all
courts
,
are
determined
in
large
part
by
the
parties
'
allegations
presented
in
their
pleadings
,
''
said
Platt
,
a
clinical
professor
of
law
.
``
One
policy
question
raised
by
cases
like
this
one
—
a
case
in
which
the
judge
sought
intervention
and
followed
the
recommendations
of
the
intervener
—
is
how
far
the
courts
in
private
custody
disputes
should
be
required
or
even
have
the
power
to
go
beyond
the
evidence
presented
to
them
,
to
affirmatively
build
a
record
that
ensures
each
child
's
safety
and
well
being
.
''
Attorneys
in
Cook
County
Public
Guardian
Robert
Harris
'
office
regularly
staff
child-protection
courtrooms
in
which
DCFS
has
taken
a
child
into
protective
custody
,
but
are
sparingly
brought
in
for
domestic
relations
cases
involving
private
parental
disputes
.
Harris
and
other
experts
say
it
's
a
systemic
problem
that
comes
down
to
a
lack
of
resources
.
He
argues
that
DCFS
should
have
more
of
a
role
in
domestic
relations
cases
.
Sandra
Mercado
,
35
,
said
she
never
suspected
the
Fords
were
abusing
Gizzell
.
She
blames
herself
for
not
doing
more
in
those
final
months
,
either
by
trying
to
enforce
her
visitation
rights
or
win
back
custody
in
court
.
The
mother
remembers
Gizzell
as
a
kind
child
who
always
had
a
smile
on
her
face
.
``
I
do
n't
want
any
mom
to
ever
have
their
child
taken
away
from
them
unfairly
,
''
Mercado
said
in
a
recent
statement
given
to
the
Tribune
by
her
lawyer
.
``
There
needs
to
be
safeguards
in
place
at
every
step
of
a
child
custody
dispute
where
the
number
one
interest
is
the
child
.
The
system
is
broken
and
failed
Gizzell
every
step
of
the
way
.
''
**
Red
flags
abounded
**
The
court
was
n't
the
only
failed
intervention
.
DCFS
became
involved
in
April
2013
,
three
months
before
her
death
,
but
the
Fords
,
who
had
made
two
hotline
calls
alleging
Gizzell
was
molested
by
her
mother
's
boyfriend
before
the
child
came
to
live
with
her
father
,
were
n't
the
focus
of
the
investigation
.
.
The
last
documented
visit
by
the
child-protection
investigator
,
Shirley
Contreras
,
to
the
Ford
apartment
took
place
on
June
11
,
records
showed
.
Contreras
did
not
report
the
conditions
that
police
vividly
described
one
month
later
on
discovering
Gizzell
's
body
.
She
arranged
for
Gizzell
to
be
interviewed
again
June
20
by
a
clinical
social
worker
.
DCFS
closed
its
case
June
26
after
concluding
the
molestation
allegations
were
unfounded
.
Chicago
police
also
could
not
substantiate
the
claims
.
Contreras
was
later
fired
for
her
work
on
the
case
for
allegedly
falsifying
a
record
of
an
interview
with
a
school
counselor
,
officials
said
.
She
declined
to
comment
.
There
were
other
troubling
missteps
as
well
.
In
mid-June
,
Dr.
Norell
Rosado
,
the
child-abuse
pediatrician
who
examined
Gizzell
as
part
of
the
molestation
investigation
at
the
Chicago
Children
's
Advocacy
Center
,
noted
what
appeared
to
be
an
older
,
healing
loop
mark
on
her
buttocks
and
linear
marks
on
her
thighs
.
Instead
of
questioning
Gizzell
alone
,
he
inquired
in
front
of
Helen
Ford
and
did
not
challenge
the
grandmother
's
answer
that
the
child
harmed
herself
.
Rosado
noted
the
injuries
in
his
report
but
did
not
make
a
call
to
the
DCFS
child
abuse
and
neglect
hotline
.
He
also
did
not
tell
either
the
DCFS
investigator
or
the
center
's
family
advocate
—
any
of
which
might
have
sparked
an
abuse
investigation
of
the
Fords
as
well
.
No
discipline
has
been
taken
against
Rosado
.
He
did
not
return
a
phone
call
seeking
comment
,
but
told
the
Tribune
in
2013
that
while
he
can
not
discuss
Gizzell
's
case
,
he
has
never
failed
to
call
the
hotline
if
he
spotted
a
sign
of
child
abuse
or
neglect
during
an
exam
.
The
DCFS
investigator
later
read
the
doctor
's
characterization
of
the
exam
as
``
normal
''
but
did
not
note
the
injuries
documented
in
the
report
,
according
to
the
DCFS
Office
of
the
Inspector
General
.
As
a
result
of
privacy
concerns
,
the
child
advocacy
centers
did
not
receive
medical
reports
at
the
time
.
Other
red
flags
abounded
for
multiple
professionals
to
notice
:
—
The
Fords
had
pulled
Gizzell
out
of
counseling
after
she
disclosed
her
anxiety
over
caring
for
her
ill
father
,
who
did
not
have
professional
in-home
medical
help
.
—
Gizzell
told
advocacy
center
staff
that
she
was
forced
for
hours
to
squat
or
stand
with
her
arms
in
the
air
—
warning
indicators
of
potential
abuse
,
according
to
experts
.
—
Gizzell
also
had
been
diagnosed
with
a
urinary
tract
infection
,
but
that
information
was
not
shared
with
advocacy
center
staff
to
ensure
she
received
follow-up
care
.
DCFS
Inspector
General
Denise
Kane
,
whose
office
investigates
abuse
or
neglect
deaths
in
Illinois
of
children
whom
DCFS
had
contact
with
in
the
last
year
of
their
lives
,
called
the
lack
of
collaboration
among
the
agencies
one
of
the
great
tragedies
of
Gizzell
's
death
.
The
child
advocacy
center
and
DCFS
have
since
agreed
to
follow
some
of
Kane
's
recommended
changes
to
protocols
that
contributed
to
the
failings
in
Gizzell
's
case
,
and
DCFS
administrators
point
to
improved
training
on
reducing
errors
,
revised
investigative
procedures
and
other
advances
they
credit
to
Gizzell
's
case
``
If
everyone
is
not
working
together
and
sharing
information
in
the
best
interest
of
the
child
,
what
are
we
doing
?
''
Kane
said
.
``
In
this
case
,
everyone
missed
the
ballgame
.
The
lack
of
integration
of
the
information
obtained
from
the
child
's
interviews
and
the
medical
exam
was
a
serious
error
.
''
The
Mercados
are
suing
Dr.
Rosado
for
alleged
medical
negligence
.
Martin
Dolan
,
Mercado
's
attorney
,
said
multiple
opportunities
to
help
Gizzell
were
missed
.
``
It
was
just
a
system
of
dropping
the
ball
,
failure
after
failure
,
until
it
was
too
late
,
''
Dolan
said
.
Following
the
Tribune
's
2013
investigation
,
Sen.
Julie
Morrison
(
D-Deerfield
)
convened
a
hearing
to
examine
a
spike
in
reported
child
deaths
and
to
determine
what
went
wrong
in
Gizzell
's
case
despite
all
the
layers
of
involvement
among
child
welfare
agencies
.
That
led
to
a
February
2016
report
by
a
subcommittee
of
the
Illinois
Children
's
Justice
Task
Force
.
``
Her
case
has
personally
inspired
me
,
''
Morrison
said
of
Gizzell
.
``
I
know
we
'll
never
prevent
every
death
,
but
we
should
always
strive
to
do
better
.
''
Dr.
Jill
Glick
,
medical
director
of
Child
Advocacy
and
Protective
Services
at
Comer
Children
's
Hospital
who
co-chaired
the
subcommittee
,
said
none
of
the
report
's
recommendations
and
suggested
legislation
is
in
place
yet
,
but
its
key
idea
—
creating
regional
multidisciplinary
teams
across
the
state
to
investigate
child
abuse
and
neglect
—
has
gained
some
ground
.
Comprised
of
members
from
DCFS
,
medical
and
advocacy
centers
,
and
police
and
state
's
attorney
's
offices
,
teams
would
be
trained
together
and
work
as
units
rather
than
collections
of
professionals
from
different
organizations
,
and
have
shared
priorities
and
work
schedules
and
report
to
the
same
bosses
.
Though
DCFS
has
been
supportive
and
four
pilot
sites
have
been
identified
,
several
obstacles
remain
,
said
Glick
,
who
is
only
somewhat
optimistic
such
teams
will
ever
be
assembled
.
``
We
work
in
our
own
vacuums
and
are
accountable
to
our
own
agencies
,
and
Gizzell
Ford
clearly
taught
us
no
one
communicates
well
with
each
other
,
''
said
Glick
,
also
a
professor
of
pediatrics
.
``
Everyone
is
looking
at
these
kids
through
a
different
lens
from
different
agencies
,
and
there
's
no
central
or
formalized
collaboration
,
even
after
Gizzell
Ford
.
To
this
day
,
for
me
to
talk
to
a
child
welfare
worker
or
get
a
hold
of
a
police
report
is
a
nightmare
.
We
still
fight
tremendous
barriers
to
communicate
with
police
and
DCFS
.
''
**
'So
much
potential
'
**
Nearly
four
years
after
her
death
,
many
still
mourn
the
bright
child
.
They
struggle
with
how
this
happened
and
live
with
regret
.
The
tragic
portrait
of
a
horribly
abused
girl
is
not
how
her
former
principal
at
the
now-shuttered
Armstrong
Elementary
School
remembers
her
.
Demetrius
Bunch
said
Gizzell
always
came
to
school
healthy
and
well
nourished
.
Helen
Ford
accompanied
her
every
morning
and
was
even
a
member
of
a
school
advisory
board
,
she
said
.
After
the
child
's
violent
death
,
Bunch
said
she
was
so
worried
that
they
might
have
missed
a
warning
sign
or
opportunity
to
intervene
that
after
interviewing
her
staff
she
went
out
and
knocked
on
doors
in
the
neighborhood
to
learn
more
about
her
home
life
.
She
said
neighbors
told
her
they
rarely
saw
Gizzell
outside
playing
with
the
other
children
,
but
none
said
they
suspected
abuse
.
``
There
was
so
much
potential
in
her
,
''
Bunch
said
.
The
girl
's
aunt
and
uncle
,
Angela
and
Osvaldo
Mercado
,
said
they
pass
the
cemetery
where
Gizzell
is
buried
near
their
home
every
day
and
often
stop
to
talk
to
her
.
To
cover
her
bruises
,
they
made
sure
she
was
dressed
in
a
pink
plaid
dress
and
long-sleeved
sweater
.
A
butterfly-engraved
headstone
marks
her
final
resting
spot
,
next
to
her
maternal
grandmother
,
Wanda
,
who
died
of
an
asthma
attack
in
2009
.
Her
uncle
said
he
bought
the
plot
for
himself
awhile
ago
,
but
chose
to
have
Gizzell
laid
to
rest
there
instead
since
his
mother
helped
raise
her
and
the
two
were
close
.
He
said
her
death
has
ripped
the
family
apart
,
and
he
struggles
with
feelings
of
anger
,
frustration
and
guilt
that
they
did
n't
insist
Gizzell
's
mother
go
back
to
court
or
refuse
to
leave
the
Ford
apartment
without
seeing
Gizzell
.
``
It
really
hurts
,
''
the
uncle
said
.
``
I
have
n't
broken
because
I
have
to
be
strong
for
my
family
,
but
the
thought
of
it
leaves
me
speechless
.
It
's
hard
to
move
forward
.
I
try
to
put
it
in
the
back
of
my
head
,
but
it
's
always
there
.
''
He
,
like
others
in
the
family
,
prays
Gizzell
's
death
is
a
catalyst
for
change
to
help
other
abused
children
.

**CHICAGO
(
CBS
)
--
**
A
27-year-old
woman
who
was
charged
in
a
2007
crash
that
killed
two
teenagers
was
charged
again
last
week
in
Riverside
with
driving
while
her
license
was
revoked
.
At
7:22
p.m.
on
March
30
,
police
responded
to
a
two-vehicle
crash
at
26th
Street
and
Harlem
Avenue
,
according
to
Riverside
police
.
No
one
was
injured
in
the
crash
and
both
drivers
said
they
didn
’
t
want
to
file
a
report
because
there
was
only
minor
damage
.
An
officer
then
recognized
Michelle
Anguiano
,
of
Lyons
,
who
was
the
driver
in
a
fatal
2007
crash
in
the
200
block
of
East
Burlington
Street
in
Riverside
that
left
two
people
dead
,
police
said
.
In
the
2007
crash
,
Anguiano
lost
control
of
her
Dodge
Neon
SRT
while
going
40
miles
over
the
posted
speed
limit
and
struck
a
tree
at
65
mph
,
splitting
the
car
in
half
,
police
said
.
The
crash
killed
Stanley
Joray
,
an
18-year-old
from
Berwyn
,
as
well
as
16-year-old
Adam
TeBockhorst
,
from
Lyons
,
and
injured
Anguiano
and
another
passenger
.
All
four
were
wearing
seat
belts
at
the
time
.
Anguiano
was
charged
with
aggravated
reckless
driving
and
sentenced
to
60
days
in
jail
,
three
years
of
probation
and
1,280
hours
of
community
service
for
the
2007
crash
,
police
said
.
Following
last
week
’
s
crash
,
officers
discovered
that
Anguiano
’
s
license
was
still
revoked
and
took
her
into
custody
,
police
said
.
She
was
charged
with
driving
while
license
revoked
and
driving
too
fast
for
conditions
and
her
2015
Jeep
was
impounded
.
Once
in
custody
,
police
checked
with
the
Cook
County
state
’
s
attorney
’
s
office
for
a
possible
felony
upgrade
on
driving
while
her
license
was
revoked
.
Because
the
2007
crash
did
not
involve
drugs
or
alcohol
but
excessive
speed
and
reckless
driving
,
there
was
no
enhancement
available
and
the
request
was
denied
,
police

SYCAMORE

—
An
Illinois
judge
has
granted
a
certificate
of
innocence
to
a
Washington
state
man
who
was
wrongly
convicted
in
2012
of
the
1957
kidnapping
and
killing
of
a
7-year-old
girl
.
The
DeKalb
County
judge
formally
declared
77-year-old
Jack
McCullough
innocent
during
a
Wednesday
court
hearing
.
The
certificate
will
allow
McCullough
to
sue
Illinois
for
damages
for
his
wrongful
conviction
in
Maria
Ridulph
’
s
killing
.
A
prosecutor
concluded
last

that
evidence
backed
McCullough
’
s
alibi
that
he
had
been
40
miles
(
64
kilometer
)
away
when
Maria
disappeared
.
A
judge
agreed
,
ordering
McCullough
’
s
release
after
he
had
served
four
years
of
a
life
sentence
.
McCullough
said
at
a
hearing
last
week
that
he
wants
justice
.
He
says
he
’
s
been
portrayed
“
as
a
monster
”
and
that
people
still
think
he
’
s
one

CHICAGO
(
SUN
TIMES
MEDIA
WIRE
)
**
\-
A
highly
regarded
Cook
County
judge
has
been
removed
from
hearing
cases
after
being
charged
by
federal
authorities
with
fraud
for
providing
false
information
to
obtain
loans
for
properties
on
the
South
Side
.
Judge
Jessica
Arong
O
’
Brien
,
49
,
was
charged
last
week
with
one
count
of
mail
fraud
affecting
a
financial
institution
,
and
one
count
of
bank
fraud
,
according
to
the
U.S.
Attorney
’
s
office
in
Chicago
.
On
Wednesday
,
Chief
Judge
Timothy
Evans
announced
that
O
’
Brien
has
been
“
reassigned
to
administrative
duties
in
the
office
of
the
Presiding
Judge
of
the
First
Municipal
District
,
Judge
E.
Kenneth
Wright
Jr.
”
The
action
followed
a
meeting
of
the
Executive
Committee
of
the
Circuit
Court
of
Cook
County
on
Tuesday
.
Administrative
duties
can
include
performing
marriage
ceremonies
and
reviewing
petitions
for
reduced
court-filing
fees
for
indigent
parties
,
a
statement
from
Evans
’
office
said
.
The
action
is
effective
immediately
and
until
further
notice
.
“
The
committee
is
aware
that
a
federal
grand
jury
indicted
Judge
O
’
Brien
on
April
12
,
and
she
is
accused
of
fraudulently
obtaining
loans
related
to
the
purchase
,
maintenance
and
sale
of
properties
in
Chicago
,
”
the
statement
said
.
“
That
same
day
,
on
April
12
,
Judge
Wright
reassigned
Judge
O
’
Brien
to
administrative
duties
until
the
Executive
Committee
could
consider
the
matter.
”
Evans
said
last
week
that
he
was
unable
to
comment
further
on
the
matter
,
citing
Supreme
Court
Rule
63
,
which
states
,
“
A
judge
should
abstain
from
public
comment
about
a
pending
or
impending
proceeding
in
any
court…
”
The
alleged
crimes
occurred
before
O
’
Brien
was
elected
the
first
female
Filipino-American
judge
in
the
Circuit
Court
of
Cook
County
in
2012
.
Federal
prosecutors
allege
O
’
Brien
got
lenders
to
provide
loans
“
by
making
false
representations
and
concealing
material
facts
in
documents
submitted
to
the
lenders.
”
An
attorney
at
the
time
,
she
used
the
loans
to
buy
and
refinance
about
$
1.4
million
in
mortgage
and
commercial
loans
,
including
the
purchase
of
an
investment
property
in
the
600
block
of
West
54th
Street
in
the
Back
of
the
Yards
,
prosecutors
said
.
She
then
fraudulently
refinanced
the
mortgage
on
that
property
and
a
second
investment
property
in
the
800
block
of
West
54th
Street
.
O
’
Brien
then
obtained
a
commercial
line
of
credit
through
fraud
to
maintain
the
properties
,
before
selling
them
to
co-defendant
Maria
Bartko
,
49
,
of
Chicago
,
and
a
straw
buyer
who
fraudulently
obtained
mortgage
loans
,
prosecutors
said
.
O
’
Brien
has
pleaded
not
guilty
and
was
released
on
her
own
recognizance
.
She
faces
4-7
years
in
prison
if
convicted
.
At
the
time
O
’
Brien
was
obtaining
the
loans
,
she
was

special
assistant
attorney
general
for

of
Revenue
,

Realty
LLC

She
was

for
Amronbanc
Mortgage
Corp.
in
north
suburban
Lincolnwood
,
where
she
met
Bartko
,
who
faces
one
count
of
mail
fraud
.
The
judge
,
who
immigrated
to
America
at

age
of
16
,
has
a

’
s
degree
in
hotel

of
the
Women

.
O
’
Brien

to

Award

for
her
more
than
4,000
hours
of

over
the

,
”
according
to
an

Julia
Gutierrez
pleaded
guilty
but
mentally
ill
Thursday
to
murdering
her
husband
,
Eduardo
,
in
their
[
Geneva
]
[
1
]
home
with
a
poisoned
smoothie
.
In
January
2016
she
gave
him
a
smoothie
containing
a
fatal
dose
of
six
Temazepam
pills
.
On
Thursday
,
she
was
sentenced
to
22
years
in
prison
as
part
of
an
agreement
with
Kane
County
prosecutors
.
Gutierrez
,
54
,
who
spoke
quietly
only
to
answer
questions
during
the
hearing
,
rocked
in
her
chair
as
the
crime
was
described
by
Assistant
State
's
Attorney
Greg
Sams
and
when
one
of
Eduardo
's
five
sisters
,
Lidia
Pyecha
,
read
a
statement
to
Judge
D.J
.
Tegeler
and
others
in
his
courtroom
.
``
It
sickens
us
to
think
Eddie
let
his
guard
down
.
Eddie
gave
his
life
for
her
,
''
Pyecha
said
.
``
His
life
was
taken
way
too
early
.
''
Another
sister
,
Rachel
Mooney
,
added
afterward
,
``
There
is
no
adjective
to
describe
how
we
feel
.
''
Geneva
police
responded
to
the
Gutierrez
's
Crissey
Avenue
home
Jan.
28
,
2016
,
after
concerned
friends
of
the
family
reported
a
``
strange
''
package
arrival
that
contained
$
40,000
in
cash
,
a
check
for
$
5,000
and
a
note
written
by
Julia
stating
``
Ed
has
been
suffering
so
much
,
''
Sams
said
.
Eduardo
``
appeared
to
be
deceased
for
some
time
''
when
officers
found
his
body
in
the
living
room
,
Sams
added
.
Julia
Gutierrez
was
located
semi-conscious
in
a
bathroom
.
Officers
reported
a
note
in
Julia
's
handwriting
that
included
statements
such
as
``
I
love
him
so
much
,
please
forgive
me
''
and
``
Hope
to
see
you
in
heaven
.
''
Numerous
prescription
pill
bottles
were
recovered
by
police
from
the
home
.
Prosecutors
have
long
suggested
the
case
was
an
attempted
murder-suicide
.
Julia
Gutierrez
told
police
she
suffered
for
years
from
an
environmental
illness
and
``
wanted
to
die
...
so
many
times
.
''
``
He
was
suffering
more
than
me
,
''
Sams
said
,
quoting
Julia
Gutierrez
's
comments
to
police
.
Despite
Julia
's
perception
,
Eduardo
's
sisters
said
their
brother
remained
upbeat
and
a
supportive
member
of
their
close-knit
family
even
though
they
did
n't
all
live
in
the
same
state
.
They
described
Eduardo
as
a
hard-working
man
dedicated
to
his

NAPERVILLE
,
Ill.
(
WLS
)
--
Naperville
police
believe
there
are
at
least
two
distinct
groups
responsible
after
more
than
20
cars
were
burglarized
in
one
weekend
.
On
the
one
hand
,
there
are
those
hitting
residential
areas
and
apartment
complexes
.
``
There
are
kids
that
go
around
at
night
,
try
car
doors
and
they
get
valuables
inside
the
car
.
And
unfortunately
,
more
often
than
not
there
are
keys
to
those
cars
in
them
as
well
,
''
said
Sgt
.
Steve
Schindlbeck
,
Naperville
Police
Dept
.
More
sophisticated
and
harder
to
track
however
,
is
a
band
of
``
smash
and
grab
''
thieves
known
as
the
Felony
Lane
Gang
.
Based
out
of
Florida
,
they
operate
all
over
the
country
and
move
around
frequently
,
targeting
folks
primarily
in
the
parking
lots
of
health
clubs
and
day
care
centers
.
``
They
park
,
they
run
in
.
Because
they
're
only
going
to
be
inside
a
short
time
they
leave
their
valuables
sitting
on
the
front
seats
.
The
members
of
the
gang
run
up
,
smash
the
window
,
help
themselves
to
the
purse
and
are
gone
within
seconds
,
''
Sgt
.
Schindlbeck
said
.
The
gang
gets
their
name
from
what
comes
next
:
pulling
up
to
the
outermost
lane
at
drive-thru
ATM
's
armed
with
their
newly
acquired
checkbooks
and
ID
's
.
And
while
tracking
thieves
is
nearly
impossible
,
preventing
the
crime
is
easy
since
most
of
those
hit
either
leave
their
car
doors
unlocked
or
leave
their
belongings
in
plain
sight
.
``
I
think
if
I
lock
the
door
,
nobody
is
going
to
break
the
glass
and
if
someone
is
breaking
the
glass
someone
is
going
to
see
them
and
stop
them
.
Plus
I
think
I
'll
be
in
and
out
in
5
minutes
and
nobody
is
going
to
bother
my
stuff
,
''
Patty
Conti
said
.
Doors
were
left
unlocked
in
every
single
one
of
the
more
than
20
burglaries
reported
over
the
weekend

\-
A
Northwest
Side
alderman
says
an
act
of
vandalism
at
his
office
Monday
,
which
apparently
targeted
his
gentrification
stance
,
will
not
deter
his
efforts
to
spur
the
local
economy
.
The
incident
occurred
at
the
office
of
1st
Ward
Alderman
Joe
Moreno
at
2740
W.
North
Ave
.
Chicago
Police
said
the
building
maintenance
staff
discovered
a
glass
door
was
smashed
and
graffiti
was
spray
painted
in
blue
on
the
building
about
6:40
a.m.
Monday
.
A
rock
had
been
thrown
through
the
window
,
and
the
word
“
gentrifier
”
sprayed
on
the
brick
wall
beside
it
,
the
alderman
’
s
office
confirmed
.
No
one
was
injured
and
nothing
was
stolen
.
An
employee
in
the
alderman
’
s
office
said
the
incident
apparently
happened
early
Monday
morning
,
prior
to
business
hours
.
In
a
statement
,
Moreno
said
,
“
This
act
of
vandalism
to
my
aldermanic
service
office
was
truly
a
cowardly
act.
”
The
1st
Ward
encompasses
parts
of
the
Logan
Square
,
Wicker
Park
,
West
Town
,
Ukrainian
Village
and
Humboldt
Park
neighborhoods
on
the
Northwest
Side
.
It
also
includes
several
neighborhoods
that
have
been
gentrifying
in
recent
years
,
with
new
apartment
buildings
and
condos
replacing
older
housing
units
and
small
businesses
.
The
alderman
has
been
the
target
of
protesters
on
several
occasions
for
his
pro-
growth
stance
.
But
he
said
this
“
incident
will
not
deter
my
efforts
to
bring
economic
progress
,
which
provides
opportunities
for
all
types
of
people
,
into
the
1st
Ward
.
It
is
a
progress
that
has
created
more
than
100
units
of
new
affordable
housing
,
with
much
more
coming
soon
,
in
our
ward.
”
“
The
1st
Ward
is
a
diverse
,
inclusive
and
welcoming
ward
,
”
Moreno
said
.
“
It
is
not
exclusionary
in
any
way
,
and
will
never
be
so
,
as
long
as
I
am
the
alderman
,
representing
ALL
of
the
great
people
who
reside
within
its
boundaries.

Police
said
no
one
was
in
custody
as
of
Tuesday
afternoon

--
An
unmarked
,
gray
tactical
van
carrying
two
undercover
Chicago

officers
was
riddled
with
bullets
by
a
high-powered
rifle
Tuesday
night
in

was
released
Wednesday
from

Chicago
Police
Superintendent
Eddie
Johnson
said
the
officers
,
one
of
whom
may
be
the
son
of
a
deputy
chief
,
were
doing
``
quite
well
.
''
Sources
said
the
second
officer
would
likely
be
discharged
later

Chicago
Fraternal

said
the

on
the
force
for
some
time
,
but
did
not
disclose
their

CPD
Chief
Spokesman
Anthony
Guglielmi
said
although
there
is
no
specific
threat
to
the
two
officers
,
Johnson
ordered
heightened
security
for
both
of
them
.
The
police
superintendent
stressed
that
the
shooters
will
be
caught
.
``
Make
no

it
.
We
're
going
to
catch
them
.
We
're
going
to
get
these
individuals
responsible
.
Listen
,
if
they
would
fire
at
police
officers
like
that
,
then
they
have
no
thought
process
in
terms
of
firing
at
other
citizens
of
this
great
city
,
''
Johnson
said
.
Investigators
questioned
three
men
overnight
.
``
We
have
some

fact
,
we
have
a

Hundreds
of

flooded
the
area
in
the
hours
after
the
shooting

conducting

massive

A
few
detectives
canvassed
the
neighborhood
Wednesday
.
It

mostly
industrial

Ashland
Cold

sits
near
the
old

has
several
surveillance
cameras
mounted
on
the
building
.
It
's
unclear
what
they
may
have
caught
on

.
Investigators
said
two
weapons
were
recovered
from
a
vehicle
seized
by
police
that
may
be
connected
to
the
shooting
.
The
AR-15
was
one
of
those
weapons
.
Guglielmi
said
ballistics
and
the
trace
on
the
assault
rifle
have
been
expedited
.
Police
said
they
believe
the
undercover
officers
may
have
been
targeted

it

``
It

a

it
is

after
a
domestic

``
My

Two
teenage
boys
are
facing
misdemeanor
charges
after
an
expressway
police
chase
that
started
with
an
apparent
attempted
robbery
in
north
suburban
Skokie
,
and
ended
with
a
crash
late
Wednesday
near
Goose
Island
on
the
Near
West
Side
.
About
10:30
p.m.
,
the
cashier
at
a
Shell
station
in
the
9
600
b
lock
of
Crawford
Avenue
called
police
to
report
a
suspicious
silver
SUV
in
the
parking
lot
,
according
to
Skokie
police
.
Two
males
got
out
of
the
vehicle
with
their
faces
covered
by
their
shirts
,
and
tried
to
enter
the
station
,
police
said
.
But
the
doors
were
locked
and
they
got
back
in
the
SUV
and
headed
north
on
Crawford
.
A
check
of
the
SUV
’
s
registration
revealed
it
had
been
stolen
from
Chicago
,
police
said
.
About
45
minutes
later
,
Skokie
detectives
located
the
vehicle
parked
behind
another
station
at
Old
Orchard
Road
and
Lawler
Avenue
.
The
driver
saw
the
detectives
and
pulled
away
,
running
a
red
light
at
the
intersection
and
pulling
onto
the
Edens
Expressway
.
Police
tried
to
stop
the
SUV
as
it
headed
north
,
but
lost
sight
of
it
.
Skokie
police
terminated
the
chase
and
Illinois
State
Police

crashed
into
a

in
the

block
of
North
Sangamon

inside
the
vehicle
got
out
and
tried
to
run
away
and
the
two
juvenile
boys
were
arrested

CHICAGO
--
Is
Chicago
still
a
sanctuary
city
?
That
’
s
one
of
the
questions
being
raised
by
a
federal
lawsuit
.
The
man
who
filed
the
suit
claims
Chicago
police
gave
false
information
about
him
to
immigration
officials
.
Wilmer
Catalan-Ramirez
has
been
in
the
McHenry
County
jail
since
March
27th
.
Today
he
was
wheeled
into
the
courtroom
and
sobbed
while
describing
his
life
in
jail
.
He
’
s
been
held
on
an
immigration
detainer
,
but
has
not
been
charged
with
any
crimes
.
He
was
paralyzed
in
a
drive
by
shooting
in
the
back
of
the
yards
neighborhood
in
January
.
Only
a
few
months
later
ICE
agents
raided
his
home
and
fractured
his
shoulder
in
a
so-called
gang
operation
.
He
says
he
is
not
and
has
never
been
a
gang
member
but
for
some
reason
he
was
listed
in
the
Chicago
police
gang
database
and
police
shared
that
information
with
ICE
.
The
father
of
three
,
who
is
an
undocumented
immigrant
,
says
he
’
s
suffering
in
jail
but
hasn
’
t
committed
a
crime
.
Today
in
court
his
lawyers
claimed
he
is
not
getting
the
medical
care
he
needs
in
jail
.
Catalan-Ramirez
testified
when
ICE
agents
came
to
his
home
he
was
terrified
and
tried
to
explain
to
them
in
English
and
Spanish
that
he
was
paralyzed
–
could
barely
walk
--
and
was
not
the
man
they
were
looking
for
.
His
family
says
they
want
him
to
get
the
medical
care
he
needs
in
jail
while
he
waits
for
a
deportation
hearing
.
Today
the
lawyer
for
the
government
said
Illinois
doesn
’
t
have
any
immigration
facilities
in
Illinois
that
can
accommodate
inmates
who
have
special
needs
.
McHenry
County
jail
officials
say
they
have
been
bending
over
backwards
to
give
Catalan-Ramirez
the
medical
care
he
needs
but
it
’
s
a
jail
,
not
a
hospital
.

CHICAGO
--
Illinois
is
set
to
eliminate
the
statute
of
limitations
in
child
sex
abuse
cases
through
legislation
passed
with
support
from
a
victim
of
imprisoned
former
U.S.
Rep.
Dennis
Hastert
.
The
Illinois
House
unanimously
approved
the
measure
on
Thursday
,
sending
it
to
a
supportive
Gov
.
Bruce
Rauner
.
Attorney
General
Lisa
Madigan
says
Hastert
's
case
provided
a
prime
example
of
why
the
law
should
be
changed
.
The
former
U.S.
House
speaker
was
sentenced
to
15
months
in
prison
in
2016
for
violating
banking
laws
while
trying
to
silence
a
victim
he
abused
when
he
was
a
teacher
and
coach
in
suburban
Chicago
decades
ago
.
The
statute
of
limitations
prevented
prosecutors
from
charging
Hastert
with
sex
abuse
.
Last
fall
,
victim
Scott
Cross
told
lawmakers
Hastert
was
a
``
monster
''
who

FOX
32
News
has
learned
that
three
prisoners
at
the
Cook
County
Jai
l
overdosed
on
heroin
last
week
,
and
had
to
be
given
emergency
shots
of
a
life-saving
drug
.
Now
,
the
sheriff
's
department
believes
it
has
identified
the
person
who
smuggled
the
heroin
into
the
jail
.
``
They
were
lethargic
and
exhibiting
signs
of
someone
who
was
overdosing
.
And
our
staff
was
on
it
right
away
,
”
said
Cook
County
Jail
Director
Cara
Smith
.
Smith
says
the
close
call
happened
last
week
in
Division
Two
of
the
jail
complex
,
a
minimum
security
building
that
houses
hundreds
of
inmates
.
Three
of
those
prisoners
snorted
heroin
and
began
to
OD
.
All
three
were
given
emergency
shots
of
naloxone
,
a
drug
that
reverses
the
effects
of
opiates
.
One
inmate
was
sent
to
Stroger
Hospital
and
the
others
were
sent
to
the
jail
's
Cermak
Health
Center
.
Jail
officials
say
security
footage
shows
a
new
inmate
passing
something
to
the
men
who
became
sick
.
``
There
are
,
unfortunately
,
sometimes
things
can
get
through
.
In
this
case
we
believe
this
person
was
hiding
the
heroin
in
his
genitals
,
”
Smith
said
.
That
suspect
was
originally
arrested
by
Chicago
police
,
who
also
apparently
missed
the
drugs
.
Assistant
Executive
Director
Jeff
Johnson
showed
FOX
32
the
machine
the
sheriffs
use
to
scan
every
inmate
that
comes
into
the
jail
,
between
125
and
175
a
day
,
which
reveals
far
more
detail
than
an
airport
scanner
.
``
Then
we
'll
get
the
image
that
we
have
right
over
here
,
gives
us
a
silhouette
.
And
this
way
the
officers
can
look
at
the
silhouette
,
and
if
there
's
anything
that
triggers
on
the
silhouette
they
're
concerned
about
,
then
they
'll
talk
to
the
individual
,
”
Johnson
said
.
Officers
can
perform
a
pat
down
,
but
Sheriff
Tom
Dart
has
banned
strip
searches
because
of
the
risk
of
lawsuits
.
Smith
says
this
is
the
first
time
they
're
aware
of
that
someone
's
been
able
to
smuggle
heroin
into
the
jail
complex
,
and
certainly
the
first
time
in
memory
they
've
had
heroin
overdoses
.
``
This
is
a
big
jail
.
We
have
a
lot
of
people
coming
through
and
occasionally
there
's
gon
na
be
these
things
that
happen
.
And
our
reaction
to
it
is
what
I
think
is
important
.
These
men
are
revived
and
are
doing
fine
now
,
”
Smith
said
.
Sheriff
’
s
officials
are
now
looking
into
possible
charges
against
the
inmate
who
smuggled
in
the
heroin
,
but
say
that
could
be
difficult
.
They
’
ve
already
conducted
a
review
of
security
procedures
.

A
La
Grange
man
has
been
charged
with
driving
drunk
and
causing
a
high-speed
crash
that
injured
another
driver
in
west
suburban
Riverside
.
Nikola
Cevizovik
,
24
,
faces
two
misdemeanor
counts
of
DUI
and
numerous
traffic
violations
following
the
May
17
crash
,
Riverside
police
announced
on
Friday
.
About
10:30
p.m.
,
Cevizovik
was
at
the
wheel
of
a
Kia
speeding
90
mph
south
on
First
Avenue
when
he
blew
through
the
red
lights
at
31st
and
Ridgewoo
d
before
crashing
into
an
SUV
that
was
backing
out
of
a
driveway
in
the
3500
block
of
South
First
,
police
said
.
The
crash
sent
the
SUV
into
a
tailspin
and
caused
it
to
flip
onto
its
side
.
The
66-year-old
Riverside
woman
driving
the
SUV
had
to
be
extricated
from
her
vehicle
,
and
was
taken
to
Loyola
University
Medical
Center
in
Maywood
,
police
said
.
She
was
treated
for
head
and
leg
injuries
,
and
released
.
Cevizovik
was
ejected
from
the
car
.
When
emergency
crews
arrived
,
he
was
“
screaming
profanities
at
the
officers
and
extremely
belligerent
with
the
paramedics
as
well
,
”
a
statement
from
police
said
.
An
officer
had
to
accompany
the
combative
Cevizovik
in
an
ambulance
,
and
he
“
displayed
obvious
signs
of
intoxication
,
”
police
said
.
He
refused
to
submit
to
a
breath
,
blood
or
urine
test
,
police
said
.
He
was
also
taken
to
Loyola
and
underwent
surgery
for
serious
shoulder
injuries
,
knee
injuries
,
facial
injuries
and
fractures
,
police
said
.
Cevizovik
was
on
parole
for
a
2014
felony
conviction
for
possession
of
a
controlled
substance
,
and
he
has
been
arrested
19
times
,
with
prior
convictions
for
burglary
and
driving
on
a
suspended
license
.
At
the
time
of
the
crash
,
his
driver
’
s
license
was
valid
.
“
Cevizovic
was
traveling
at
an
extremely
high
rate
of
speed
and
caused
a
collision
that
could
have
been
deadly
if
not
for
the
seatbelt
use
by
the
victim
,
”
Riverside
Police
Chief
Tom
Weitzel
said
in
a
statement
.
“
The
fact
that
he
was
driving
drunk
8
days
after
being
paroled
from
custody
for
a
drug
charge
is
a
clear
sign
that
his
substance
abuse
is
a
danger
to
the
public
sharing
our
roadways.

.
Rainey
most
recently
served
as
chief
of
the
San
Francisco
Bay
Area
Rapid
Transit
Police
Department
until
his
retirement
at
the
end
of
last
year
.
He
took
over
the
department
during
the
turmoil
after
the
shooting
death
of
Oscar
Grant
by
BART
officers
in
2010
and
was
tasked
with
cleaning
up
the
department
.
At

will
report
to
Eric
M.
Heath
,
associate
vice
president
for
the
university
’
s
department
of
safety
and
security
.
“
One
of
the
many
valuable
areas
of
expertise
Kenton
brings
to
the
University
of
Chicago
is
his
involvement
with
creating
innovative
,
community-based
policing
strategies
,
”
Heath
said
.
“
Throughout
his
law
enforcement
career
,
Kenton
has
worked
in
diverse
communities
,
where
he
built
strong
and
positive
relationships
with
community
members
and
successfully
implemented
new
policing
programs
,
resulting
in
effective
policing
efforts.
”
The
job
is
a
homecoming
for
Rainey
,
who
is
originally
from
Chicago
,
though
has
worked
for
most
of
his
career
in
law
enforcement
agencies
in
California
and
Ohio
.
“
The
University
of
Chicago
is
a
world-class
organization
,
and
it
is
an
honor
and
privilege
for
me
to
have
been
selected
for
this
position
,
”
said
Rainey
.
“
I
’
m
excited
to
work
with
the
members
of
the
university
’
s
police
department
,
the
university
’
s
students
,
faculty
and
staff
,
and
area
community
members
so
that
together
we
can
achieve
our
public
safety
mission.
”
Rainey
replaces
Fountain
Walker
,
who
left
to
join
Heath
’
s
predecessor
,
Marlon
Lynch
,
in

safety
at

you
might
be

to
convince
someone
there
to
deactivate
a

The
city
of
Chicago
on
Friday
shut
down
12

at
six

,
following
the
results

.
Northwestern

says
the
unpopular
red-light

have
delivered
“
significant

benefits
,
”
but
zeroed
in
on
six
crossings
with
two
cameras
each
where
results
were
not
significant
,
the
Chicago
Department
of

said

Governor
Bruce
has
signed
into
law
legislation
that
reforms
the
state
’
s
bail-bond
system
so
that
poor
people
who
commit
minor
offenses
don
’
t
languish
in
jail
.
Governor
Rauner
signed
the
legislation
at
Dr.
Willie
Wilson
’
s
Chicago
Baptist
Institute
International
on
the
South
Side
.
“
Today
we
make
sure
that
folks
who
commit
a
minor
offense
,
non-violent
offense
,
petty
,
that
they
’
re
not
forced
to
sit
in
jail
languishing
for
days
,
weeks
months
,
simply
because
they
don

t
have
the
cash
to
post
bail
,
”
Rauner
said
.
Wilson
had
championed
bail
reform
and
has
even
put
up
his
own
money
for
some
who
committed
minor
offenses
.
He
noted
that
the

of
people
in
jail
are
minority
and
poor
.
“
This
is
a
serious
issue
for
not
only
us
as
African
Americans
but
for
this
country
,
”
Wilson
said
.
Chicago
State
Representative
Elgie
Sims
said
after

in

for
three
days
a

said
at

“
the
criminal
justice
system
must
be
fair
from
beginning

end
.
“
And
it
undermines
everything
we
try

do
to
legitimize
the

system
when
we
punish
those
simply
because
they
are
impoverished

still
are
a
threat
to
others.

Weekend
shootings
along
the
downtown
R
iverwalk
and
at
31st
Street
beach
should
not
discourage
summer
tourists
and
everyday
Chicagoans
from
flocking
to
two
of
the
city
’
s
most
enduring
attractions
,
Chicago
Police
Supt
.
Eddie
Johnson
said
Monday
.
The
Riverwalk
incident
occurred
when
the
attraction
was
officially
closed
to
the
public
,
Johnson
noted
.
“
They
were
somewhere
where
they
weren
’
t
supposed
to
be
.
But
as
a
result
of
this
,
we
’
re
meeting
with
our
business
partners
in
the
Riverwalk
area
just
to
make
sure
the
security
plan
is
what
it
should
be
,
”
the
superintendent
told
the
Chicago
Sun-Times
.
Overall
,
on
a
weekend
when
temperatures
rose
into
the
90s
,
six
men
were
killed
and
at
least
37
other
people
were
wounded
in
shootings
across
Chicago
between
Friday
evening
and
Monday
morning
.
But
the
beach
and
Riverwalk
incidents
got
the
most
attention
.
At
the
31st
Street
Beach
,
two
16-year-old
boys
were
critically
wounded
in
a
shooting
about
7
p.m.
Sunday
.
On
the
Riverwalk
,
about
2
a.m.
Sunday
,
two
men
,
ages
28
and
30
,
were
involved
in
an
argument
near
Wacker
and
Dearborn
when
shots
rang
out
.
Mayor
Rahm
Emanuel
completed
the
downtown
Riverwalk
with
help
from
a
$
99
million
federal
construction
loan
.
If
random
shootings
prompt
Chicagoans
and
tourists
to
stay
away
from
the
Riverwalk
,
the
mayor
could
have
a
tough
time
generating
the
concession
revenue
he
needs
to
retire
that
federal
loan
.
The
city
’
s
Department
of
Fleet
and
Facilities
Management
,
which
manages
the
Riverwalk
,
uses
unarmed
security
guards
,
patrolling
on
foot
,
to
enforce
an
11
p.m.
curfew
.
“
That
’
s
why
we
’
re
gon
na
meet
with
the
business
community
down
there
—
to
evaluate
it
and
see
what
they
can
pitch
in
because
security
is
everybody
’
s
responsibility
,
”
Johnson
said
.
“
After
hours
,
we
’
re
obviously
not
going
to
be
there
every
minute
.
But
we
’
ll
come
up
with
a
plan
so
that
,
between
CPD
and
business
owners
,
we
have
it
more
secure
down
there.
”
Fleet
and
Facilities
Management
Commissioner
David
Reynolds
could
not
be
reached
for
comment
.
Johnson
on
Monday
blamed
both
incidents
on
“
petty
disputes
settled
with
guns.
”
“
These
were
all
young
folks
.
One
was
a
dispute
about
a
girl
.
The
other
was
a
dispute
about
coolers
on
the
beach
,
”
Johnson
told
the
Sun-Times
.
Those
disputes
don
’
t
concern
the
public
at
large
,
he
added
,
and
police
were
“
close
”
to
making
arrests
.
“
The
culture
of
accountability
is
just
delinquent
in
Chicago
.
You
don
’
t
settle
petty
disputes
like
that
with
a
gun
,
”
he
said
.
Johnson
emphasized
that
the
Riverwalk
shooting
occurred
“
after
the
public
is
barred
from
being
over
there.
”
Chicago
Police
“
patrol
that
area
religiously
”
between
6
p.m.
and
midnight
,
then
do
“
random
patrols
”
after
midnight
,
he
said
.
“
Those
were
not
random
incidents
.
.
.
they
were
targeted
at
groups
of
people
that
knew
each
other
.
.
.
.
These
weren
’
t
street
robberies
or
things
of
that
nature
,
”
Johnson
said
.
The
31st
Street
shooting
occurred
in
broad
daylight
on
a
crowded
beach
filled
with
families
seeking
refuge
from
the
blistering
summer
heat
.
But
Johnson
nevertheless
urged
South
Siders
not
to
be
afraid
of
taking
their
children
to
the
beach
.
“
It
’
s
still
between
two
groups
of
folks
that
knew
each
other
.
.
.
.
But
again
,
it
was
a
petty
dispute
that
they
settled
with
a
gun
,
”
he
said
.
Police
Department
spokesman
Anthony
Guglielmi
insisted
there
is
nothing
to
fear
.
“
We
have
district
[
officers
]
there
until
midnight
and
then
,
every
hour
,
or
hour
and
a
half
,
officers
will
walk
through
there
.
Those
folks
got
in
in-between
that
gap
.
But
the
onus
of
accountability
is
on
the
individuals
.
Clearly
,
the
law
states
that
you
can
’
t
be
there
at
that
time
,
”
he
said
.

A
23-year-old
man
has
been
charged
with
sexually
assaulting
a
woman
he
knew
early
Sunday
in
southwest
suburban
Orland
Park
.
Martynas
Sadzevicius
faces
one
felony
count
of
criminal
sexual
assault
,
according
to
Orland
Park
police
.
In
the
early
morning
hours
Sunday
,
Sadzevicius
picked
the
woman
,
in
her
late
teens
,
up
in
his
car
and
drove
her
to
his
Orland
Park
home
,
where
they
parked
in
the
driveway
,
police
said
.
Sadzevicius
sexually
assaulted
her
in
the
vehicle
.
The
woman
reported
the
assault
and
Sadzevicius
was
arrested
at
his
home
later
Sunday
,
police
said
.
Sadzevicius
was
ordered
held
on
a
$
100,000
bond
Tuesday
during
a
hearing
at
the
Bridgeview
courthouse
,
police
said
.
He
is
next
scheduled
to
appear
in
court
July
10
.

Two
Cook
County
Jail
inmates
were
charged
Thursday
with
sexually
assaulting
a
female
detainee
in
a
lock-up
area
at
the
courthouse
in
south
suburban
Markham
last
month
.
Hamidullah
Tribble
,
21
;
and
Nelson
Drake
,
23
,
were
both
charged
with
sexually
assaulting
a
52-year-old
female
inmate
May
2
in
a
holding
area
for
prisoners
outside
a
courtroom
at
the
Cook
County
Courthouse
at
16501
Ke
dzie
Ave.
in
Markham
,
according
to
the
Cook
County
state
’
s
attorney
’
s
office
.
Following
an
apparent
breach
of
protocol
,
the
Sheriff
’
s
Department
asked
State
’
s
Attorney
Kim
Foxx
in
May
to
investigate
how
a
female
detainee
wound
up
in
a
cell
with
two
male
inmates
before
an
encounter
that
was
possibly
sexual
in
nature
,
the
Chicago
Sun-Times
previously
reported
.
Among
other
things
,
Foxx
was
tasked
with
investigating
the
inmates
’
opposing
claims
about
the
incident
.
Tribble
and
Drake
told
guards
the
female
inmate
threatened
them
with
a
syringe
and
demanded
sex
after
they
were
placed
in
the
holding
area
;
the
woman
claimed
the
men
instigated
the
sexual
encounter
,
and
no
syringe
was
found
.
Both
men
remain
in
custody
at
the
Cook
County
Jail
,
Foxx
said
.
Tribble
is
being
held
on
a
$
100,000
bond
on
charges
of
aggravated
kidnapping
of
a
child
,
possession
of
a
stolen
motor
vehicle
,
and
unlawful
restraint
,
according
to
prosecutors
.
Drake
is
being
held
without
bond
on
a
first-degree
murder
charge
,
and
a
separate
case
in
which
he
is
charged
with
attempted
murder
,
armed
robbery
,
aggravated
discharge
of
a
firearm
and
aggravated
unlawful
restraint
.
They
will
appear
in
bond
court
at
9
a.m.
June
29
in
Markham
on
the
new
sexual
assault
charge
,
prosecutors
said
.
Cara
Smith
,
chief
of
policy
for
Sheriff
Tom
Dart
,
said
it
was
unclear
last
month
how
the
male
and
female
inmates
were
able
to
have
unsupervised
contact
at
the
courthouse
,
which
does
not
have
security
cameras
.
All
corrections
officers
assigned
to
that
shift
have
been
reassigned
to
other
duties
.

The
[
Los
Angeles
Police
Department
]
[
60
]
has
long
hailed
its
cadet
program
as
a
successful
partnership
between
police
and
the
city
’
s
young
residents
.
The
initiative
is
designed
to
help
cadets
develop
life-building
skills
,
bond
with
officers
and
volunteer
at
events
such
as
Dodgers
games
and
the
L.A.
Marathon
.
But
on
Wednesday
night
,
three
of
those
teenagers
crossed
paths
with
city
police
officers
in
a
way
that
LAPD
officials
surely
hoped
would
never
happen
—
when
they
became
suspects
.
Racing
through
the
streets
of
South
L.A.
in
a
pair
of
stolen
police
cruisers
,
three
teenage
cadets
led
LAPD
officers
on
car
chases
that
ended
in
separate
crashes
,
Chief
Charlie
Beck
said
Thursday
afternoon
.
The
chases
sparked
an
investigation
that
revealed
some
of
the
cadets
may
have
also
stolen
a
bulletproof
vest
,
two
stun
guns
and
two
police
radios
,
the
chief
said
.
Instead
of
learning
from
officers
,
Beck
said
,
the
cadets
“
may
have
been
impersonating
”
police
while
driving
the
stolen
cruisers
in
Central
and
South
Los
Angeles
and
Inglewood
.
The
embarrassing
incident
has
prompted
a
“
top-to-bottom
”
review
of
the
cadet
program
as
well
as
the
systems
the
LAPD
uses
to
check
out
and
track
its
equipment
.
“
We
’
re
going
to
look
at
this
,
we
’
re
going
to
look
at
how
they
did
it
,
and
we
’
re
going
to
make
sure
it
can
’
t
be
done
again
,
”
Beck
said
.
The
teens
,
who
were
not
identified
because
they
are
minors
,
were
arrested
in
connection
with
the
theft
of
the
cruisers
and
other
LAPD
property
,
Beck
said
.
All
three
teens
are
members
of
the
cadet
program
and
from
15
to
17
years
old
,
Beck
said
.
He
added
that
all
three
teens
were
involved
in
the
vehicle
thefts
but
that
it
was
not
immediately
clear
which
teens
were
involved
in
the
theft
of
the
other
equipment
.
LAPD
cruisers
have
to
be
signed
out
through
an
automated
system
before
they
are
driven
out
of
a
department
motor
pool
,
but
the
cadets
were
“
sophisticated
enough
”
to
manipulate
the
system
by
logging
in
with
the
name
of
a
sergeant
who
they
knew
was
on
vacation
.
“
They
gamed
that
system
,

One
of
the
cadets
was
so
well-regarded
within
the
program
that
the
teen
’
s
picture
was
used
in
recruitment
materials
hoping
to
entice
other
youths
to
join
up
,
according
to
three
law
enforcement
sources
with
knowledge
of
the
investigation
.
Promotional
materials
with
the
teen
’
s
picture
were
quickly
taken
down
,
said
the
sources
,
who
requested
anonymity
in
order
to
discuss
the
case
candidly
.
The
department
became
aware
that
two
LAPD
cruisers
had
gone
missing
around
5
p.m.
on
Wednesday
,
sparking
an
investigation
that
Beck
said
“
almost
immediately
”
focused
on
a
16-year-old
female
cadet
assigned
to
77th
Street
Division
after
officials
found
video
of
the
teen
fueling
the
car
at
a
city
gas
pump
.
At
about
9:30
p.m.
,
two
stolen
cruisers
were
spotted
near
77th
Street
Division
’
s
headquarters
.
A
chase
began
after
the
drivers
ignored
officers
’
commands
to
pull
over
,
Beck
said
.
The
stolen
cars
separated
at
some
point
,
resulting
in
two
chases
that
both
ended
in
car
wrecks
.
One
of
the
stolen
cruisers
crashed
near
San
Pedro
and
77th
streets
,
while
the
other
collided
with
an
uninvolved
motorist
near
Central
Avenue
and
Adams
Boulevard
,
Beck
said
.
Los
Angeles
police
officers
who
were
chasing
one
of
the
vehicles
were
also
involved
in
a
crash
.
No
officers
were
injured
,
Beck
said
.
One
of
the
cadets
was
wearing
a
spare
bulletproof
vest
used
for
training
purposes
when
the
crash
happened
,
the
chief
said
.
A
subsequent
investigation
revealed
that
a
third
car
had
also
been
taken
by
the
cadets
,
but
it
was
quickly
recovered
near
the
LAPD
’
s
77th
Street
station
,
Beck
said
.
Two
Tasers
,
two
police
radios
and
a
bulletproof
vest
were
also
recovered
during
the
investigation
,
he
said
.
No
firearms
went
missing
,
and
there
were
no
weapons
in
the
stolen
cruisers
,
according
to
Beck
.
Investigators
believe
they
have
identified
the
primary
suspects
,
but
interviews
are
still
being
conducted
to
determine
if
anyone
else
was
involved
,
Beck
said
.
One
of
the
cruisers
was
stolen
from
the
parking
garage
at
Central
Division
downtown
several
days
ago
,
according
to
two
law
enforcement
sources
.
One
of
the
others
was
taken
from
77th
Street
Division
,
one
source
said
.
One
of
the
cars
may
have
been
missing
since
late
May
,
according
to
Beck
,
who
said
investigators
are
still
trying
to
piece
together
a
timeline
of
the
cadets
’
alleged
actions
.

LAPD
brass
has
long
pointed
to
the
cadet
program
as
a
success
story
.
Thousands
of
young
people
between
13
and
20
have
participated
over
the
years
.
The
goal
is
to
foster
relationships
between
the
city
’
s
youth
and
police
while
helping
participants
develop
skills
that
will
aid
them
later
in
life
.
Currently
,
about
2,300
cadets
are
enrolled
.
Cadets
participate
in
an
18-week
academy
training
program
,
taking
various
classes
while
getting
an
introduction
to
police
work
.
After
completing
their
training
,
cadets
can
be
assigned
to
one
of
the
city
’
s
police
stations
,
where
they
may
volunteer
for
a
wide
array
of
tasks
,
including
passing
out
fliers
alerting
residents
about
crimes
in
their
neighborhood
.
The
program
isn
’
t
limited
to
teens
who
want
to
become
police
officers
.
Those
who
join
must
have
at
least
a
2.0
grade-point
average
and
submit
a
written
recommendation
,
according
to
the
program
’
s
website
.
They
can
not
have
a
serious
criminal
record
.
Beck
said
that
he
hoped
news
of
the
thefts
would
not
taint
what
is
otherwise
a
productive
program
.
“
We
’
re
very
proud
of
our
cadet
program
,
”
he
said
.
“
I
don
’
t
want
the
actions
of
these
three
individuals
to
reflect
negatively
on
the
other
2,300.

as
he
tried
to
flee
,
and
bystanders
surrounded
Sosa
until

arrived
,
Scaduto
said

Sosa
,
who
was
hospitalized
and
did
not

A
federal
judge
on
Tuesday
approved
a
settlement
in
the
wrongful-death
lawsuit
filed
by
the
parents
of
[
Michael
]
[
4
]
[
Brown
]
[
4
]
,
an
unarmed
,
black
18-year-
old
,
whose
fatal
shooting
by
a
white
police
officer
nearly
three
years
ago
in
Ferguson
,
Missouri
,
set
off
months
of
protests
.
Financial
terms
of
the
settlement
approved
by
U.S.
District
Judge
E.
Richard
Webber
were
not
disclosed
.
Anthony
Gray
,
the
attorney
for
Brown
's
parents
,
declined
comment
,
as
did
Ferguson
Mayor
James
Knowles
III
.
Michael
Brown
Sr.
and
Lezley
McSpadden
sued
the
city
,
former
Police
Chief
Tom
Jackson
and
former
police
officer
Darren
Wilson
in
2015
.
They
argued
that
the
death
of
their
son
deprived
them
of
financial
support
through
his
future
potential
wages
.
Their
lawsuit
also
described
the
police
culture
in
Ferguson
as
hostile
to
black
residents
,
and
said
Wilson
used
excessive
and
unreasonable
force
in
fatally
shooting
Brown
during
an
Aug.
9
,
2014
,
confrontation
on
a
street
.
Ferguson
,
Jackson
and
Wilson
denied
the
allegations
.
Wilson
was
cleared
of
wrongdoing
,
but
the
shooting
led
to
sometimes
violent
unrest
in
Ferguson
,
a
St.
Louis
suburb
.
Wilson
resigned
from
the
police
force
in
November
2014
,
soon
after
a
St.
Louis
County
grand
jury
announced
he
would
not
be
indicted
.
The
[
U.S.
Department
of
Justice
]
[
5
]
also
found
no
grounds
to
prosecute
Wilson
.
But
the
investigation
led
to
a
Justice
Department
lawsuit
over
racially
biased
police
and
court
practices
.
A
settlement
calls
for
significant
changes
in
operations
,
including
sensitivity
training
for
officers
,
adoption
of
community
policing
techniques
,
court
reforms
and
other
measures
.
The
process
is
expected
to
cost
more
than
$
2
million
and
could
take
years
.
Webber
's
three-page
ruling
discloses
nothing
about
the
settlement
amount
,
but
said
it
is
``
fair
and
reasonable
compensation
for
this
wrongful
death
claim
and
is
in
the
best
interests
of
each
Plaintiff
,
''
with
the
money
to
be
split
between
Michael
Brown
Sr.
and
McSpadden
.
Webber
also
wrote
that
the
agreement
``
shall
remain
sealed
by
this
Court
and
shall
be
considered
a
closed
record
''
because
disclosure
of
the
information
``
could
jeopardize
the
safety
of
individuals
involved
in
this
matter
,
whether
as
witnesses
,
parties
,
or
investigators
.
''
He
did
not
elaborate
.
Settlements
involving
public
money
and
public
entities
such
as
cities
are
typically
open
under
Missouri
law
,
but
Webber
wrote
that
the
value
of
opening
the
record
``
is
outweighed
by
the
adverse
impact
to
Plaintiffs
.

SUN-TIMES
MEDIA
WIRE
**
\-
The
family
of
a
woman
killed
along
with
an
off-duty
Chicago
Police
officer
in
a
crash
that
followed
a
police
pursuit
on
the
West
Side
early
Tuesday
has
filed
a
federal
civil
rights
lawsuit
claiming
wrongful
death
and
excessive
force
.
The
officer
killed
in
the
crash
in
Lawndale
was
identified
by
the
Cook
County
medical
examiner
’
s
office
on
Friday
as
32-year-old
Taylor
Clark
,
a
South
Loop
resident
.
A
police
spokesman
would
not
confirm
that
information
.
The
Independent
Police
Review
Authority
is
investigating
the
crash
,
which
occurred
when
officers
in
an
unmarked
police
vehicle
saw
the
off-duty
officer
’
s
personal
SUV
near
Roosevelt
and
Independence
shortly
before
1
a.m
.
The
officer
—
who
had
worked
as
a
tactical
officer
in
the
Ogden
(
10th
)
District
for
four
years
—
drove
through
the
intersection
of
Roosevelt
and
Kostner
at
“
a
high
rate
of
speed
”
and
collided
with
a
vehicle
driven
by
27-year-old
Chequita
Adams
,
killing
them
both
,
according
to
Police
Supt
.
Eddie
Johnson
.
An
autopsy
on
the
officer
,
pronounced
dead
at
Stroger
Hospital
at
2:55
a.m.
,
did
not
rule
on
cause
and
manner
of
death
,
with
results
pending
further
investigation
,
according
to
the
medical
examiner
’
s
office
.
In
a
Facebook
post
on
the
page
of
the
Suburban
Unity
Alliance
,
a
friend
of
Clark
wrote
that
the
officer
had
worked
for
the
Chicago
Park
District
for
four
years
as
a
recreational
instructor
for
kids
at
the
Austin
Town
Hall
.
“
This
is
a
hard
pill
to
swallow
because
Clark
was
also
the
coach
of
the
very
teens
I
’
m
looking
after
now
.
Clark
was
also
a
popular
DJ
at
one
point
before
he
decided
to
take
on
his
dream
of
being
an
officer
of
the
law
.
Clark
was
shy
,
creative
,
eager
and
a
fitness
fanatic
,
”
the
friend
wrote
.
Adams
was
taken
to
Mount
Sinai
Hospital
,
where
she
died
at
1:27
a.m.
,
according
to
the
medical
examiner
’
s
office
.
An
autopsy
did
not
rule
on
cause
and
manner
of
death
,
with
results
pending
further
investigation
.
She
lived
in
the
West
Side
North
Lawndale
neighborhood
.
On
Thursday
,
Adams
’
family
filed
a
federal
lawsuit
naming
the
city
,
Clark
’
s
estate
,
and
the
unknown
driver
of
the
pursuing
police
vehicle
.
The
suit
claims
CPD
“
does
not
adequately
train
its
officers
to
determine
how
and
when
they
may
use
force
and/or
engage
in
or
disengage
from
pursuits
;
appropriately
supervise
officers
to
identify
dangerous
tactics
or
behaviors
that
may
indicate
an
officer
needs
additional
training
or
other
intervention
;
review
its
force
and/or
pursuit
practices
as
a
whole
to
identify
problematic
trends
or
patterns
that
endanger
officers
and
others
;
review
its
officers
’
force
and/or
pursuit
incidents
to
determine
whether
the
force
used
and/or
pursuit
complied
with
the
law
or
departmental
policy
;
or
punish
officers
who
use
unconstitutional
and
excessive
force
or
wrongful
pursuit
tactics
against
citizens
causing
great
harm
or
death.
”
It
says
the
pursuing
officer
had
“
no
probable
cause
to
believe
the
occupant
of
Clark
’
s
vehicle
had
committed
a
crime
,
”
but
still
engaged
in
a
“
reckless
pursuit
”
and
“
never
disengaged
”
until
the
crash
.
It
claimed
the
pursuit
was
carried
out
“
in
the
face
of
imminent
danger
and
in
gross
disregard
and
indifference
for
the
safety
of
others…
”
It
charges
Clark
with
civil
battery
for
“
driving
at
reckless
speeds
though
a
residential
neighborhood
,
”
and
claims
the
city
should
have
disciplined
the
pursuing
officer
.
A
city
spokesman
declined
the
comment
,
stating
that
the
city
has
not
yet
received
the
suit
.
Police
spokesman
Anthony
Guglielmi
said
earlier
that
the
officer
had
finished
his
shift
10
minutes
before
and
was
driving
to
his
girlfriend
’
s
home
.
His
vehicle
matched
the
description
of
one
used
in
an
earlier
carjacking
.
But
it
was
not
the
same
vehicle
,
police
said
.
After
a
short
pursuit
,
the
on-duty
officers
turned
off
their
vehicle
’
s
lights
and
left
“
a
great
distance
”
between
their
vehicle
and
that
of
the
off-duty
officer
,
Guglielmi
said
.
Johnson
said
that
,
since
the
crash
involved
an
officer
,
he
asked
Sharon
Fairley
and
IPRA
to
take
the
lead
in
the
investigation
“
in
the
name
of
impartiality
and
public
integrity.
”
“
We
have
a
lot
of
work
ahead
of
us
,
”
Fairley
said
.
Johnson
said
that
it
was
not
known
if
the
officers
in
pursuit
knew
that
the
driver
was
an
off-duty
officer
.
A
visibly
disheartened
Johnson
said
,
“
I
really
want
to
say
how
sorry
we
are
that
this
happened
because
it
really
was
an
unnecessary
loss
of
life
.
It
’
s
just
a
tragedy.
”
Grief
counselors
were
also
assigned
to
the
Ogden
District
Tuesday
to
aid
grieving
officers
,
Johnson
said
.

A
woman
charged
with
killing
four
of

smiled
and
flashed
a
double
thumbs
up
to
news
cameras
during
her
first
court
appearance
Friday
in
metro
Atlanta
before
telling
a
judge
she
does

attorney

said
the
woman

.
Isabel
Martinez
,
33
,
appeared
before
Gwinnett
County
Magistrate
Court
Judge
Michael
Thorpe
a
day
after
police
said
she
stabbed
the
five
to
death
and
seriously
injured
another
child
at
her
home
.
The
surviving
9-year-old
girl
remained
hospitalized
with
serious
injuries
.
Before
the
hearing
began
,
Martinez
sat
with
other
inmates
and
posed
for
cameras
—
smiling
,
giving
the
thumbs
up
,
putting
her
hands
in
a
prayer
position
and
spreading
her
arms
out
wide
.
As
Thorpe
listed
the
charges
—
five
counts
of
malice
murder
,
five
counts
of
murder
and
six
counts
of
aggravated
assault
—
Martinez
smiled
,
shook
her
head
``
no
''
and
wagged
her
finger
at
him
.
``
Ma'am
,
I
'm
going
to
caution
you
to
cut
out
the
display
for

,
''
he
said
.
``
It
's
really
not
a
good
idea
,
probably
not
to
your
benefit
.
''
When
Thorpe
said
she
had
a
right
to
an
attorney
,
she
replied
through
a
Spanish-
language
interpreter
that
she
does
n't
want
one
.
She
later
added
that
her
attorney
will
always
be
the
people
``
that
we
're
fighting
for
''
and
her
faith

Thorpe
advised

appointed

Meanwhile
,
U.S.
Immigration
and
Customs
Enforcement
spokesman
Bryan
Cox
said
in
an
email
Friday
that
Martinez
—
whom
he
identified
as
Maria
Isabel
Garduno-
Martinez
—
is
from
Mexico
and
entered
the
U.S.
illegally
.
This
is
her
first
encounter
with
immigration
authorities
,
and
it
's
not
clear
how
long
she
has
been
in
the
U.S.
,
Cox
said
.
Local
officials
called
the
killings
``
horrendous
.
''
``
What
prompts
a
person
to
take
the
life
of
such
innocent
children
and
her
spouse
is
something
we
may
never
understand
,
''
Gwinnett
County
police
said
in
a
statement
.
Psychologists
and
others
who
study
cases
of
mothers
killing
their
children
say
it
's
not
as
uncommon
as
people
might
believe
.
But
media
coverage
often
focuses
on
dramatic
cases
,
such
as
Andrea
Yates
,
who
was
found
not
guilty
by
reason
of
insanity
for
the
2001
drowning
deaths
of
her
five
children
in
her
suburban
Houston
home
.
Other
cases
get
less
attention
,
as
when
a
woman
kills
a
newborn
or
in
children
's
deaths
blamed
on
neglect
,
said
Cheryl
Meyer
,
a
psychology
professor
at
Wright
State
University
in
Ohio
and
co-author
of
two
books
on
mothers
who
have
killed
children
based
on
about
1,000
cases
during
the
1990s
.
In
cases
when
mothers
kill
intentionally
,
Meyer
said
there
is
often
another
influence
,
such
as
mental
health
issues
or
the
loss
of
a
close
loved
one
.
``
We
like
to
classify
these
women
as
pariahs
,
that
they
are

at
all
like
us

Meyer
said
.
``
I

that
was
not
the
case

A
can
of
beer
left
at
the
scene
of
a
strangulation
nearly
two
decades
ago
at
a
Far
South
Side
motel
led
authorities
to
an
inmate
serving
a
60-year
sentence
for
another
woman
's
slaying
.
Henry
Sandifer
,
59
,
appeared
before
Judge
Maria
Kuriakos
Ciesil
,
who
denied
bail
during
a
hearing
at
the
Leighton
Criminal
Court
Building
on
Wednesday
afternoon
.
Sandifer
was
charged
with
first-degree
murder
in
the
death
of
Angela
Renee
Kirkling
,
who
was
33
when
she
arrived
at
the
Royal
Motel
,
4
5
W.
103rd
St
.
,
on
Jan.
17
,
2000
,
with
a
male
companion
,
according
to
prosecutors
and
records
.
A
desk
clerk
checked
Kirkling
in
about
9:20
a.m.
with
the
understanding
that
she
would
be
checking
out
about
eight
hours
later
,
at
5:20
p.m
.
But
when
it
got
to
be
6
p.m.
and
she
hadn
’
t
left
,
a
staffer
entered
her
room
and
found
Kirkling
lying
on
the
floor
wearing
only
socks
,
prosecutors
said
.
An
autopsy
determined
Kirkling
,
of
the
300
block
of
West
105th
Street
in
Chicago
,
died
of
strangulation
and
her
death
was
declared
a
homicide
,
according
to
Cook
County
medical
examiner
and
other
records
held
by
the
Tribune
.
A
beer
can
found
in
the
room
was
inventoried
and
analyzed
for
DNA
evidence
,
which
came
back
as
a
match
to
Sandifer
,
prosecutors
said
.
It
was
not
clear
why
it
took
so
many
years
before
charges
were
brought
in
Kirkling
’
s
killing
,
but
when
he
was
arrested
he
was
already
in
custody
at
the
Menard
Correctional
Center
serving
a
60-year
sentence
for
the
murder
of
45-year-
old
Linda
Morgan

Morgan
was
found
strangled
,
beaten
bound
and
wrapped
in
a
blanket
inside
a
South
Side
garbage
bin
in
2008

who
held
a

had
been

After

her
missing

already
made
.
``
We
started
out
with
two
layers
.

so
it

three

four
in
some
spots
,
''
said
Curt
Wittrock
,
another

keep
going

the
power
keeps
going
,
we
should
be
OK.

MORGAN
PARK
—
A
compilation
video
of
students
fighting
at
[
Morgan
Park
High
School
]
[
7
]
went
viral
this
week
after
being
posted
on
Facebook
.
The
video
set
to
music
shows
both
students
fighting
as
well
as
other
mischief
at
the
school
at
1744
W.
Pryor
Ave
.
The
video
posted
on
Saturday
had
519,777
views
as
of
Wednesday
morning
.
[
Principal
Carolyn
Epps
]
[
8
]
said
the
videos
were
taken
early
last
year
.
She
said
the
students
involved
in
the
videos
were
all
disciplined
according
or
[
Chicago
Public
School
]
[
9
]
policies
.
A
CPS
spokesman
said
that
``
based
on
physical
markers
in
the
videos
''
some
of
the
footage
is
more
than
a
year
old
.
``
I
do
n't
know
why
it
is
recirculating
,
''
Epps
said
of
the
videos
,
which
appeared
recently
on
several
Facebook
pages
for
Morgan
Park
alumni
.
[
Carisa
Parker
]
[
10
]
is
the
[
chairwoman
]
[
11
]
of
the
local
school
council
and
a
1992
graduate
of
the
school
affectionately
known
among
alums
as
Empehi
.
Two
of
her
children
have
graduated
as
Mustangs
.
Her
daughter
is
in
eighth
grade
at
the
school
's
academic
center
.
She
said
fighting
has
become
an
increasing
problem
in
``
the
last
couple
of
years
.
''
Parker
believes
it
was
due
to
Epps
and
the
council
focusing
too
much
on
improving
test
scores
at
the
school
[
with
1,377
students
]
[
12
]
.
So
improving
school
climate
was
made
a
priority
last
year
.
Parker
estimated
about
30
students
were
causing
the
bulk
of
the
problems
.
Epps
reached
out
to
the
parents
of
those
students
in
an
effort
to
find
a
solution
.
Still
,
the
[
2016
School
Progress
Report
]
[
12
]
compiled
by
CPS
ranked
the
school
``
[
very
weak
]
[
12
]
``
in
the
safety
category
.
This
category
asks
respondents
,
``
Do
students
feel
safe
in
and
around
the
school
building
and
traveling
to
and
from
school
?
''
Michael
Passman
,
a
spokesman
for
CPS
,
said
incidents
of
serious
misconduct
have
been
actually
fallen
by
20
percent
over
the
past
two
years
at
Morgan
Park
.
And
from
the
2013-2016
school
years
,
out-of-school
suspensions
dropped
by
67
percent
,
expulsions
decreased
by
74
percent
and
notifications
to
the
[
Chicago
Police
Department
]
[
13
]
fell
by
39
percent
,
he
said
.
``
This
disturbing
footage
is
a
montage
of
old
videos
that
do
not
reflect
the
current
culture
and
climate
of
Morgan
Park
High
School
.
Significant
progress
has
been
made
at
the
school
to
provide
a
safe
and
positive
environment
for
all
students
and
staff
,
''
Passman
said
.
Brandee
Stanton
of
West
Pullman
graduated
from
Morgan
Park
in
1997
.
Initially
,
she
scrolled
past
the
video
on
her
Facebook
feed
and
was
upset
by
others
who
were
sharing
it
and
commenting
.
She
said
some
of
those
who
commented
and
shared
the
video
said
they
did
so
in
the
hope
that
parents
and
others
would
see
it
and
work
to
correct
the
behavior
if
they
spotted
their
children
in
the
footage
.
``
I
hate
to
see
that
.
I
hate
to
see
any
youth
behaving
badly
,
''
said
Stanton
,
who
once
pictured
her
son
following
in
her
footsteps
by
becoming
a
Mustang
once
he
graduates
from
elementary
school
in
three
years
.
Stanton
also
previously
worked
as
a
school
nurse
for
CPS
.
She
said
fights
are
common
at
all
high
schools
,
and
she
does
n't
believe
the
video
proves
Morgan
Park
has
any
more
or
less
of
a
problem
than
anywhere
else
.
``
These
are
teenagers
.
There
is
peer
pressure
,
boyfriends
and
girlfriends
,
''
she
said
.
Stanton
also
said
she
's
heard
of
[
her
alma
mater
's
International
Baccalaureate
]
[
14
]
program
and
other
good
things
happening
at
the
Morgan
Park
.
Nevertheless
,
she
's
leaning
toward
sending
her
children
to
a
different
school
.
``
Why
would
[
area
families
]
send
their
children
to
the
neighborhood
school
where
they
do
n't
think
they
are
safe
?
''
she
said
.
Such
sentiment
troubled
Parker
.
She
admitted
improving
school
safety
must
remain
a
priority
.
But
she
also
thinks
that
highlighting
the
success
of
her
alma
mater
also
becomes
increasing
important
in
the
wake
of
the
video
.
``
We
need
to
tell
our
story
or
other
people
will
tell
it
for
us
,
''
she
said
.
``
Most
of
the
kids
who
go
to
Morgan
Park
are
great
kids
.

had
a
silver
Leader
bicycle
frame
,
Parker
said
.
Parker
,
21
,
said
the
thieves
were
in
their
late
teens
or
early
20s
,
Hispanic
and
black
,
wearing
hoodies
and
all
of
them
carried
messenger-style
bags
on
their
backs
.
Lloyd
Peters
,
a
cyclist
who
is
friends
with
Parker
,
said
the
cyclist
community
will
not
stand
for
robberies
on
the
606
.
``
The
bicycle
community
is
definitely
on
the
lookout
for
the
thieves
,
and
they
should
know
they
are
n't
welcome
on
any
group
rides
or
other
events
in
the
bicycle
community
here
in
Chicago
,
''
Peters
said
.
Parker
,
who
lives
in
Berwyn
,
said
he
does
not
usually
use
the
606
,
but
he
did
on
Friday
night
because
he
was
going
from
one
friend
's
apartment
right
next
to
the
606
to
another
friend
's
apartment
farther
down
on
the
606
,
less
than
a
block
off
the
trail
.
Parker
said
that
he
was
unlikely
to
use
the
606
at
night
alone
anymore
,
although
he
would
continue
to
ride
in
the
daytime
or
while
on
a
large
group
ride
.
Parker
said
he
filed
a
police
report
online
Monday
morning
.
Police
did
not
immediately
comment
on
his
report
.
Peters
said
he
feels
as
if
there
is
``
a
wave
of
people
who
think
they
can
get
away
with
thefts
,
and
no
one
can
catch
them
.
''
``
We
want
to
make
sure
everyone
enjoys
what
Chicago
has
given
us
.
We
have
a
lot
of
people
who
use
the
606
,
and
we
are
tired
of
being
pointed
out
as
criminals
.
Those
bikes
[
the
thieves
'
bikes
and
the
stolen
bike
]
are
easy
to
spot
by
anyone
who
rides
.
We
—
cyclists
of
the
606
—
are
watching
,
and
we
will
not
stand
for
this
,

Peters
added

A
48-year-old
man
was
shot
Monday
night
in
the
South
Side
Englewood
neighborhood
.
He
was
walking
down
the
street
about
8:15
p.m.
in
the
6700
block
of
South
Green
when
he
heard
shots
and
felt
pain
,
according
to
Chicago
Police
.
The
man
suffered
a
gunshot
wound
to
the
lower
,
right
back
,
police
said
.
He
was
taken
to
Stroger
Hospital
,
where
his
condition
stabilized
.

Drivers
nabbed
by
Chicago
police
for
talking
on
their
cellphones
or
texting
behind
the
wheel
did
not
get
the
chance
to
have
their
cases
heard
in
the
correct
court
,
so
the
city
should
return
money
to
people
who
paid
tickets
,
a
lawsuit
filed
Tuesday
contends
.
The
suit
was
filed
in
Cook
County
Circuit
Court
by
the
same
law
firm
that
[
recently
landed
a
massive
settlement
]
[
2
]
from
the
city
in
a
lawsuit
over
the
handling
of
red
light
and
speeding
camera
tickets
.
It
alleges
the
city
took
the
cases
to
municipal
administrative
court
for
years
in
a
bid
to
keep
all
the
fines
rather
than
sharing
the
money
with
county
and
state
authorities
.
The
suit
says
state
law
dictates
the
tickets
should
instead
have
gone
to
state
traffic
court
,
where
fines
would
have
been
divvied
up
.
The
city
``
purposefully
circumvented
the
Illinois
statutory
scheme
for
prosecuting
alleged
distracted
driving
offenses
and
reporting
offenders
,
''
according
to
the
suit
filed
by
the
law
firm
Myron
M.
Cherry
&
amp
;
Associates
.
``
Rather
than
send
alleged
ordinance
violators
to
state
traffic
court
,
the
city
misrouted
allegedly
distracted
drivers
to
the
city
's
private
'administrative
'
justice
system
.
The
reason
was
simple
:
money
.
''
Drivers
have
fewer
opportunities
to
prove
their
innocence
in
administrative
court
than
in
state
court
,
according
to
the
suit
.
Since
the
beginning
of
2010
,
``
many
tens
of
thousands
''
of
drivers
in
Chicago
paid
cellphone
tickets
,
according
to
the
suit
,
which
seeks
to
make
those
drivers
part
of
a
class
action
to
get
their
money
back
.
The
lawsuit
seeks
refunds
on
tickets
issued
beginning
in
2010
because
that
's
when
a
state
law
took
effect
requiring
such
distracted
driving
citations
to
go
to
state
traffic
court
.
Tickets
in
cellphone
driving
cases
now
cost
$
100
.

The
Chicago
City
Council
first
outlawed
talking
on
hand-held
cellphones
while
driving
in
2005
.
A
Chicago
police
spokesman
said
the
department
was
not
able
to
immediately
tally
how
many
cellphone
tickets
police
had
issued
.
Jacie
Zolna
,
one
of
the
attorneys
who
filed
the
suit
,
said
this
is
part
of
a
pattern
of
the
city
trying
to
milk
residents
for
money
.
``
It
's
another
case
of
the
city
viewing
municipal
ordinance
violations
as
a
personal
piggy
bank
.
I
think
people
are
getting
sick
of
it
,
''
Zolna
said
.
City
Law
Department
spokesman
Bill
McCaffrey
declined
to
comment
,
saying
the
city
had
not
had
time
to
review
the
suit
.
Last
month
,
the
City
Council
approved
a
$
38.75
million
settlement
in
a
lawsuit
Zolna
brought
alleging
the
city
broke
its
own
rules
on
issuing
automated
camera
traffic
tickets
.
The
settlement
includes
money
from
a
$
26.75
million
pot
the
city
will
use
to
reimburse
people
who
paid
red
light
and
speed
camera
tickets
after
the
city
failed
to
issue
second
notices
of
violation
as
required
until
2015
.
Lawyers
will
get
about
$
11.7
million
of
that
money
.
The
city
will
forgive
an
additional
$
12
million
in
unpaid
tickets
as
part
of
the
deal

When
Elijah
Johnson
turns
5
in
a
few
days
,
it
's
likely
he
'll
still
be
wearing
a
bandage
around
his
left
forearm
where
he
was
shot
a
week
before
his
birthday
.
``
It
's
still
wrapped
up
for
now
,
''
Elijah
's
father
,
Everitt
Johnson
,
said
Tuesday
.
The
wound
needs
time
to
heal
,
Johnson
said
.
But
there
's
a
much
deeper
hurt
afflicting
the
boy
.
Elijah
's
mom
,
Nikia
Betts
,
28
,
was
also
shot
as
the
two
walked
from
the
boy
's
great-grandmother
's
house
to
his
grandmother
’
s
house
in
North
Austin
last
Friday
afternoon
.
His
mother
was
hit
in
the
head
and
died
at
Mt
.
Sinai
Hospital
.
Elijah
ran
as
his
mother
lay
in
the
alley
,
Johnson
said
.
At
Stroger
Hospital
,
the
little
boy
kept
looking
down
at
the
wound
through
his
left
arm
.
Family
members
later
realized
the
boy
also
suffered
a
graze
wound
to
his
right
leg
.
“
He
wasn
’
t
crying
or
anything
,
”
Johnson
said
,
noting
that
his
son
was
released
after
a
night
in
the
hospital
.
“
He
’
s
strong.
”
Johnson
can
only
hope
his
son
finds
the
strength
to
recover
from
the
loss
of
his
mother
.
“
He
’
s
been
to
church
a
lot
,
we
’
ve
been
taking
him
,
”
Johnson
said
.
“
His
understanding
is
,
mother
’
s
with
Jesus.
”
Having
a
child
so
young
endure
such
physical
and
emotional
pain
has
caused
Johnson
to
consider
leaving
Chicago
.
“
These
young
guys
,
they
don
’
t
care
about
anything
.
They
need
to
stop

Man
,
they
getting
out

too
much

bring
herself
to
talk
to
her
nephew
about
the
death
of
his

were
at

's
house
when
McGee
showed
up
after
getting
her
hair
braided
.
Betts
said
she
liked
it
.
McGee
was
also
sporting
a
fresh
nose
piercing
–
except
Betts
immediately
knew
it
was
fake
,
the
teen
recalled
with
a
laugh
.
That
was
the
last
time
she
would
see
her
big
sister
alive
.
A
little
later
,
their
grandmother
called
to
ask
for
help
getting
``
Muffin
,
''
her
Chihuahua
,
out
from
under
a
bed
at
the
house
she
shared
with
Betts
and
her
sons
.
Betts
and
Elijah
decided
to
take
a
walk
to
help
her
.
After
helping
to
get
the
dog
,
they
headed
back
out
.
Five
minutes
later
,
Suttle
heard
gunshots
and
ran
outside

Neighborhoods
host
block
parties

there
are

do
what
they
're
supposed
to
do
,

it

not

you

Northwestern
spokesman
Alan
Cubbage
said
Lathem
has
been
placed
on
administrative
leave
and
banned
from
entering
Northwestern
campuses
.
Management
at
Lathem

s
building
sent
a
letter
to
other
residents
,
assuring
them
they
don
’
t
need
to
worry
about
security
.
The
same
letter
suggests
the
murder
could
have
been
a
domestic
incident
.
According
to
an
alert
broadcast
to
officers
on
police
radios
,
Warren
and
Lathem
are
considered
armed
and
dangerous
,
and
police
are
urged
to
``
use
extreme
caution
''
if
they
are
located
.
According
to
police
,
the
two
were
last
seen
driving
a
rented
gray

Maria
Rodriguez

and
operating
a

.
About
3:20
a.m.
Wednesday
,
the
24-year-old
victim
heard
gunfire
and
was
shot
in
the
chest
in

disciplinary
authorities
have
reopened
their
investigation
into
a
2014
shooting
by
officers
that
sparked
protests
and
a
federal
lawsuit
.
The
[
Independent
Police
Review
Authority
]
[

]
will
re-examine
the
death
of
19
-year-old
Roshad
McIntosh
,
who
police
shot
three
years
ago
on
the
West
Side
,
agency
spokeswoman
Mia
Sissac
said
.
McIntosh
's
family
has
filed
a
lawsuit
alleging
he
was
unarmed
when
police
chased
him
into
a
yard
and
shot
him
as
he
tried
to
surrender
.
Department
officials
said
at
the
time
of
the
shooting
that
officers
responded
to
a
call
of
armed
men
and
saw
suspects
matching
the
descriptions
they
'd
been
given
.
McIntosh
ran
off
,
and
an
officer
chased
and
shot
him
after
he
pulled
weapon
,
pointed
it
at
the
officer
and
refused
to
drop
it
,
police
officials
said
.
Top
IPRA
officials
decided
to
reopen
the
case
after
receiving
a
request
to
do
so
from
the
family
and
examining
the
original
investigation
,
Sissac
said
.
The
agency
determined
in
October
2015
that
shooting
was
within
department
policy
,
she
said
.
``
After
a
thorough
review
of
the
investigative
file
,
we
found
sufficient
reason
to
re-open
the
case
for
further
investigation
,
''
Sissac
said
in
a
written
statement
.
``
A
re-opened
case
is
not
an
indication
that
the
findings
will
be
modified
,
but
only
that
further
investigation
is
necessary
.
''
The
case
was
closed
just
a
month
before
Mayor
[
Rahm
Emanuel
]
[
13
]
was
forced
by
a
judge
to
release
video
of
an
officer
shooting
black
teenager
[
Laquan
McDonald
]
[
14
]
16
times
.
The
video
of
the
October
2014
shooting
sparked
heated
protests
,
upended
both
the
Police
Department
and
the
city
's
disciplinary
system
and
caused
political
reverberations
that
continue
.
People

Before
the
upheaval
stoked
by
the
McDonald
shooting
,
IPRA
had
ruled
that
only
two
out
of
more
than
400
shootings
by
police
violated
policy
.
Early
in
the
McDonald
scandal
,
then-IPRA
Chief
Administrator
Scott
Ando
resigned
and
Emanuel
appointed
former
federal
prosecutor
Sharon
Fairley
to
the
post
.
Fairley
has
since
ruled
that
several
shootings
violated
policy
and
reopened
controversial
cases
from
the
past
.
Emanuel
also
moved
to
replace
IPRA
with
the
new
Civilian
Office
of
Police
Accountability
,
which
is
scheduled
to
open
in
September
with
more
staff
and
funding
.
On
Thursday
,
activists
called
on
Cook
County
State
's
Attorney
Kim
Foxx
to
bring
charges
against
the
officer
who
shot
McIntosh
,
whose
identity
has
not
been
publicly
confirmed
by
the
Police
Department
.
But
a
spokeswoman
for
Foxx
,
Tandra
Simonton
,
said
in
a
written
statement
,
``
At
the
present
time
,
we
have
no
intention
of
reopening
the
criminal
investigation
into
the
McIntosh
shooting
.
''
``
In
the
event
we
become
aware
of
material
new
evidence
,
we
will
evaluate
whether
such
evidence
impacts
our
decision
as
to
potential
criminal
charges
,
''
she
wrote
.
A
protest
was
scheduled
for
late
Thursday
morning
near
where
McIntosh
was
killed
at
Polk
Street
and
Francisco
Avenue
.
Police
Department
spokesmen
could
not
immediately
be
reached
for
comment
,
while
a
spokesman
for
the
union
that
represents
rank-and-file
officers
declined
to
comment
,
saying
he
had
not
reviewed
the

are
condemning
a
``
major
,

''
brawl
outside
a
Canaryville
youth
baseball
park

shows
a
fraction
of
the
crowd
actually
fighting
,
though
at
least
one
man
used
a
bat
to
attack
someone
.
The
fight
only
lasted
a
few
minutes
,
and
police
arrived
at
the
scene
shortly
after
,
the
video
shows
.
Groups
continued
to
yell
at
each
other
,
at
which
point
someone
off
screen
,
likely
an
officer
,
yells
``
Stop
.
Who
needs
an
ambulance
?
''
No
arrests
were
made
on
the
scene
as
officers
``
were
unable
to
determine
who
the
aggressor
was
,
''
a
police
spokesman
said
.
The
investigation
is
ongoing
,
police
said
.
The
incident
on
Monday
was
a
continuation
of
an
argument
between
parties
that
began
at
a
game
Friday
night
,
said
Ald
.
Patrick
D.
Thompson
(

described
it
as
a
``
major
,
major
fight

''
A
security
plan
is
being
implemented
around
the
ballpark
,
Thompson
said

In
a
statement

league
officials
said
the
parties

fight
have
been

''
``
Although
this
event
took
place
outside
the
fences
of
the
Little
League
Ballpark
and
could
happen
anywhere
,
we
simply

There

The
mother
of
a
14-year-old
boy
held
onto
wooden
stairs
early
Sunday
as
she
asked
her
son
for
forgiveness
.
``
I
'm
so
sorry
,
''
she
said
.
``
I
was
n't
there
for
you
.
Oh
,
my
baby
.
I
'm
so
sorry
.
Get
up
,
please
.
''
Officers
surrounded
the
woman
as
she
clung
to
the
staircase
and
looked
up
.
It
led
to
the
body
of
her
son
,
Damien
Santoyo
,
who
was
slumped
over
in
the
middle
of
the
steps
.
A
blanket
covered
his
body
,
though
one
of
his
legs
was
visible
.
About
2:35
a.m.
,
her
son
was
with
two
other
boys
outside
of
a
home
in
the
1700
block
of
South
Newberry

Avenue
in
Pilsen
when
people
inside
a
passing
car
yelled
gang
slogans
at
them
.
Someone
in
the
car
opened
fire
,
fatally
striking
her

arrived
to
gather
evidence
.
The
mother
stayed
nearby
.
``
I
want
my
son
's
clothes
,
''
she
yelled
.
``
Please
,
that
's
mine
.
''
A
crowd
had
been
gathered
outside
the
crime
scene
for
hours
when
about
a
handful
of
gunshots
were
heard
just
before

a.m.
One
woman
ordered
a
teen
boy
to
stand
closer
to
the
crime

The
sound
of
the
sirens
from
an
ambulance
led
to
the
800
block
of
West
19th
Street
,
less
than
half
a
mile
from
the
crime
scene
.
A

.
A
detective
pulled
over
two
men
in
a
gray
vehicle
that
was
near
the
19th
Street
shooting
.
Braulia
McWilliams
,
a
longtime
Pilsen
resident
,
woke
up
to
a
loud
bang
in
her
neighborhood
.
Using
her
binoculars
,
she
looked
outside
of
her
window
and
saw
the
commotion
.
It
was
n't
the
first
time
that
violence
had
struck
her
block
.
``
It
's
calmed
down
a
lot
,
''
she
said
.
``
These
kids
probably
do
n't
even
live
around
here
.
''
When
gang
graffiti
was
plastered
outside
her
home
,
she
painted
a
Christmas
tree
to
cover
it
up

``
This
is
my
property
,
''
McWilliams
said
.
``
I
pay
the
taxes
.
''
Nearby
,
a
27-year-old
woman
grew
worried
for
her
brother
,
who
works
late
,
after
she
woke
up
to
the
gunshots
.
It
was
the
third
consecutive
day
she
had
heard
gunfire
in
the
neighborhood
.
``
Not
been
this
bad
in
a
long
time
,
''
she
said
.
From
18th
Street
,
which
divided
the
shootings
,
the
cries
of
the
14-year-old
boy
's
mother
and
grandmother
echoed
.
The
boy
's
grandmother
,
Erlinda
Criado
,
had
spent
much
of
the
time
sitting
on
a
curb
crying
.
A
woman
at
one
point
sat
next
to
her
and
rubbed
her
back
.
Her
grandson
had
been
in
her
Ashburn
home
when
,
at
some
point
in
the
night
,
he
sneaked
out
with
a
friend
and
ended
up
in
Pilsen
,
she
said
.
``
My
baby
,
''
Criado
said
.
``
These
(
expletive
)
streets
took
my
baby
.
''
The
teen
had
moved
from
Texas
to
Chicago
less
than
a
year
ago
.
He
played
football
in
Texas
,
and
she
insisted
that
her
grandson
was
n't
tied
to
a
gang
.
``
I
always
told
him
do
n't
let
the
streets
call
you
,
''
Criado
said
,
using
Spanish
and
English
.
``
Please
,
do
n't
waste
away
.

CHICAGO
(
WLS
)
--
Police
have
released
surveillance
video
they
hope
will
lead
to
arrests
in
a
series
of
burglaries
on
Chicago
's
Southwest
Side
.
Five
businesses
have
been
targeted
in
the
Chicago
Law
n
neighborhood
over
the
last
several
days
,
police
said
.
``
I
actually
was
surprised
.
I
expected
when
I
showed
up
early
that
morning
to
find
broken
glass
or
some
kind
of
break
in
,
''
said
Erasto
Acuna
,
Zacatacos
.
Erasto
Acuna
arrived
at
his
Zacatacos
restaurant
on
Pulaski
early
Saturday
after
the
alarm
company
called
.
He
noticed
the
cylinder
from
the
front
door
lock
was
missing
and
some
things
were
out
of
place
.
``
We
found
the
drawer
on
that
side
and
the
register
hanging
on
that
side
,
''
Acuna
said
.
The
would-be
thief
did
n't
find
any
cash
and
was
out
in
two
minutes
.
Acuna
has
since
replaced
the
cylinder
with
a
theft-deterring
ring
.
``
It
seems
like
it
's
going
to
be
a
little
harder
to
use
a
device
or
a
tool
to
just
remove
the
cylinder
,
''
he
said
.
It
seems
someone
is
using
the
same
technique
nearby
.
Chicago
police
put
out
an
alert
after
several
business
in
the
West
Lawn
neighborhood
were
robbed
-
and
it
all
started
with
tampering
with
the
lock
cylinder
.
Early
Tuesday
morning
,
surveillance
video
at
Bud
's
Flowers
on
63rd
Street
caught
a
man
focused
on
the
front
door
's
lock
cylinder
with
some
type
of
tool
.
He
got
inside
,
found
some
cash
and
was
out
in
three
minutes
.
``
I
think
he
knew
what
he
was
doing
.
He
was
pretty
fast
,
in
and
out
,
''
said
Glenn
Krol
,
Bud
's
Flowers
.
The
owner
of
Bud
's
Flowers
has
since
upgraded
the
cylinder
in
front
.
There
is
now
a
rim
around
the
cylinder
-
an
added
feature
suggested
by
his
locksmith
.
He
only
wished
he
'd
taken
the
suggestion
before
the
break-in
.
``
Listen
to
your
locksmith
,
''
Krol
said
.
The
cylinder
guard
only
costs
$
10
,
Krol
's
locksmith
said
.
If
you
do
a
fix
like
this
,
he
recommends
using
a
licensed
locksmith
registered
with
the
Illinois
Department
of
Financial
and
Professional
Regulation
.

AUSTIN
,
Texas
—
Tropical
Storm
Harvey
has
been
looming
around
for
some
time
now
in
the
Western
Gulf
of
Mexico
and
is
now
expected
to
be
a
major
hurricane
by
the
time
that
it
makes
landfall
somewhere
around
Corpus
Christi
,
Texas
late
on
Friday
or
early
on
Saturday
.
In
addition
to
coastal
counties
,
some
areas
in
Central
Texas
are
being
placed
under
a
tropical
storm
warning
.
Those
areas
include
the
counties
of
Bastrop
,
Fayette
and
Caldwell
counties
,
which
could
use
the
rain
however
,
the
amounts
that
some
forecasters
are
calling
for
could
be
devastating
for
the
region
.
Meteorologist
Conley
Isom
says
that
the
storm
could
produce
as
much
as
15
inches
of
rain
over
parts
of
Texas
,
but
the
exact
location
is
still
widely
unknown
.
“
Once
Harvey
moves
inland
on
Saturday
,
it
is
still
expected
to
stall
somewhere
near
San
Antonio
”
,
Isom
says
.
In
the
Texas
Hill
Country
,
residents
will
see
a
fine
line
between
lots
of
rain
and
smaller
amounts
of
rain
depending
on
where
you
are
located
.
Isom
predicts
that
much
of
the
Hill
Country
will
see
somewhere
between
1
to
3
inches
of
rain
but
as
you
go
further
east
along
Interstate
35
and
beyond
,
flooding
is
a
strong
possibility
.
Jackson
county
,
Texas
which
is
located
along
the
Texas
coast
near
the
city
of
Victoria
has
been
one
of
the
first
to
call
for
a
voluntary
evacuation
order
in
their
area
.
Jackson
County
has
some
particularly
flood
prone
areas
which
has
led
emergency
managers
there
to
call
for
this
move
.
Officials
in
Jackson
County
have
advised
the
public
that
there
will
be
a
public
shelter
located
at
the
County
Services
building
,
for
residents
who
wish
to
evacuated
from
that
area
.
Residents
are
being
told
that
the
shelter
will
not
open
until
sometime
on
Friday
morning
.
There
have
been
other
evacuations
ordered
including
Texas
A
&
amp
;
M
University
Corpus
Christi
,
which
is
situated
right
on
the
water
.
The
University
has
asked
that
the
campus
be
evacuated
and
that
students
and
staff
prepare
for
what
will
be
a
major
event
along
the
Texas
coast
.
NOAA
Hurricane
Hunter
aircraft
are
on
their
way
to
further
investigate
Harvey
and
will
likely
provide
further
data
later
on
today
which
will
give
forecasters
a
better
idea
on
where
Harvey
will
end
up
.
Texans
generally
wish
to
help
each
other
in
situations
such
as
this
,
and
Isom
says
that
the
best
way
to
do
that
is
consider
donating
to
the
American
Red
Cross
or
donating
supplies
to
local
relief
organizations
.

A

shot
late

Indiana
couple
accomplishes
goal
of
visiting
every
Cracker
Barrel
!

TUALATIN
,
Oregon
–
They
finally
did
it
!
An
Indiana
couple
has
accomplished
their
goal
of
visiting
every
Cracker
Barrel
location
.
[
Ray
and
Wilma
Yoder
,
80
,
of
Goshen
,
Indiana
]
[
11
]
,
flew
out
west
over
the
weekend
so
the
couple
could
visit
their
645
th
Cracker
Barrel
on
Monday
morning
at
the
grand
opening
of
the
new
Tualatin
,
Oregon
location
.
The
monumental
occasion
also
happened
to
be
Ray
’
s
81
st
birthday
,
and
the
restaurant
even
put
up
a
sign
to
welcome
them
.
Ray
Celebrated
with
blueberry
pancakes
,
and
Wilma
had
eggs
and
sausage
.
All
expenses
were
paid
by
Cracker
Barrel
,
according
to
[
KOIN6
]
[
12
]
.
“
Well
,
it
’
s
quite
special
.
These
little
farm
kids
aren
’
t
used
to
all
this
hype
,
”
Ray
told
KOIN6
.
Their
quest
began
40
years
ago
when
Ray
delivered
recreational
vehicles
across
the
country
for
Coachman
.
He
always
chose
to
eat
at
Cracker
Barrel
because
he
liked
the
food
,
and
more
importantly
,
he
liked
the
atmosphere
.
“
It
took
the
boredom
out
of
being
on
the
road
,
”
Ray
told
the
[
Lebanon
Democrat
]
[
13
]
.
“
It
has
a
down-home
spirit
,
and
everybody
is
friendly
.
It
’
s
like
being
at
home.
”
His
wife
Wilma
eventually
joined
him
on
the
trips
,
and
after
spending
[
over
30
years
together
on
the
road
]
[
14
]
,
they
checked
off
hundreds
of
Cracker
Barrel
locations
from
their
list
.
But
don
’
t
worry
;
this
isn
’
t
the
end
of
their
journey
.
Cracker
Barrel
is
opening
two
new
locations
next
year
in
Beaverton
,
Oregon
and
Jantzen
Beach
,
Oregon
,
so
they
plan
to
take
another
trip
out
west
very
soon
.

Adrian
Jones
'
short
,
tortured
life
was
spent
isolated
from
outsiders
,
confined
in
filthy
,
mice-infested
houses
where
he
was
``
home-schooled
''
by
the
parents
who
ultimately
killed
him
,
according
to
court
documents
.
But
the
abuse
he
suffered
at
the
hands
of
his
father
and
stepmother
were
meticulously
documented
,
through
dozens
of
surveillance
cameras
.
As
his
family
moved
from
place
to
place
across
Kansas
and
Missouri
,
his
stepmother
captured
photos
of
the
horrors
,
images
stored
online
and
later
recovered
by
authorities
.
His
was
a
brief
life
of
great
suffering
,
as
described
by
police
and
prosecutors
.
The
story
has
been
extensively
reported
by
the
Kansas
City
Star
and
other
local
media
,
including
KSHB
.
In
several
instances
,
Adrian
was
shown
strapped
to
a
table
and
blindfolded
,
or
standing
in
neck-deep
water
in
the
family
's
dirty
swimming
pool
overnight
.
In
other
photographs
,
his
mouth
looks
bloody
and
bruised
,
his
teeth
rotting
,
his
hands
swollen
from
being
restrained
,
the
Kansas
City
Star
reported
.
In
another
picture
,
Adrian
appears
to
be
tied
up
with
a
plate
of
food
in
front
of
him
,
a
bar
of
soap
in
his
mouth
.
Alongside
one
of
the
images
,
reportedly
captured
from
a
surveillance
camera
by
the
stepmother
,
there
appeared
two
words
:
the
boy
.
During
his
final
days
in
fall
2015
,
the
young
boy
was
trapped
in
a
white-tiled
shower
stall
and
left
to
die
,
according
to
affidavits
cited
by
the
Associated
Press
.
Prosecutors
later
said
Adrian
essentially
starved
to
death
.
His
body
was
fed
to
pigs
,
authorities
said
.
The
young
boy
's
remains
were
found
in
a
livestock
pen
on
the
family
's
property
on
Nov.
20
,
2015
.
His
father
,
Michael
Jones
,
told
authorities
he
purchased
the
swine
after
keeping
the
body
inside
the
home
for
nearly
two
weeks
,
the
AP
reported
.
A
child
told
investigators
he
heard
Adrian
screaming
``
I
'm
going
to
die
''
through
a
vent
and
his
stepmother
,
Heather
Jones
,
telling
him
to
``
suck
it
up
.
''
Michael
and
Heather
Jones
both
pleaded
guilty
last
year
to
first-degree
murder
and
were
sentenced
to
life
in
prison
.
Investigators
referred
to
the
child
abuse
case
as
one
of
the
``
worst
things
''
they
had
ever
seen
.
His
disturbing
case
prompted
a
state
lawmaker
to
introduce
legislation
that
would
penalize
adults
who
fail
to
report
child
abuse
at
home
.
In
the
Kansas
City
area
,
Adrian
became
known
,
hideously
,
as
``
the
boy
who
was
fed
to
pigs
.
''
But
with
his
killers
behind
bars
,
Adrian
's
family
has
been
left
wondering
-
could
the
state
have
done
more
to
prevent
the
boy
's
death
?
Records
in
both
Missouri
and
Kansas
reveal
a
``
seemingly
endless
series
of
reports
and
hotline
calls
''
that
informed
social
service
and
child
welfare
agencies
of
the
abuse
Adrian
suffered
.
So
alleged
a
wrongful-death
lawsuit
filed
in
both
states
this
week
by
Adrian
's
biological
mother
,
maternal
grandmother
and
oldest
sister
.
It
contends
that
child
service
agencies
failed
to
keep
Adrian
out
of
harm
's
way
.
``
Despite
all
the
warning
signs
,
the
hotline
calls
,
and
the
evidence
of
the
child
's
mistreatment
,
they
effectively
allowed
his
father
and
stepmother
to
continue
to
abuse
,
torture
,
and
ultimately
murder
the
little
boy
,
while
they
stood
idly
by
,
writing
it
all
down
,
''
the
family
's
lawyer
claimed
in
the
lawsuit
.
The
lawsuit
alleges
that
the
state
's
intervention
was
``
limited
''
to
instructing
Adrian
's
father
and
stepmother
to
sign
a
piece
of
paper
agreeing
to
stop
abusing
the
boy
-
``
the
legal
equivalent
of
a
'pinky
swear
.
'
''
``
As
it
turned
out
,
that
signed
paper
might
as
well
have
been
A.J
.
's
death
warrant
,
''
the
family
's
lawyer
,
Michaela
Shelton
,
wrote
.
The
lawsuit
asks
for
$
25,000
in
damages
.
Representatives
from
the
Kansas
Department
for
Children
and
Families
declined
to
comment
to
the
Kansas
City
Star
.
But
a
spokeswoman
previously
released
a
statement
about
the
case
,
saying
that
the
agency
followed
the
family
as
Michael
and
Heather
Jones
``
worked
constantly
to
evade
our
intervention
.
''
``
This
family
moved
frequently
between
Kansas
and
Missouri
,
which
greatly
disrupted
continuity
of
services
and
evaluation
,
''
the
spokeswoman
said
in
a
statement
to
KSHB
.
Officials
in
both
states
remained
in
regular
contact
,
shared
information
and
continued
to
talk
to
the
family
,
the
spokeswoman
said
,
adding
that
child
welfare
workers
thoroughly
investigated
each
reported
incident
of
alleged
abuse
and
neglect
.
``
It
is
very
difficult
to
assist
families
who
are
constantly
transient
,
especially
those
who
move
across
state
lines
and
thereby
deprive
the
State
of
any
jurisdiction
,
''
the
statement
read
.
For
Adrian
's
first
two
years
of
life
,
he
lived
with
his
biological
mother
and
siblings
in
Lawrence
,
Kansas
.
After
the
toddler
was
found
at
home
unsupervised
,
he
was
removed
from
his
mother
's
home
and
placed
in
the
custody
of
his
father
.
But
within
three
months
of
Adrian
moving
in
with
his
father
,
Kansas
child
welfare
workers
became
aware
of
problems
in
the
home
.
Hotline
calls
began
pouring
in
with
troubling
information
:
His
father
had
guns
all
over
the
house
,
his
stepmother
was
observed
to
be
high
on
drugs
,
according
to
the
lawsuit
.
Adrian
's
siblings
were
reported
to
have
suffered
significant
weight
loss
and
a
number
of
physical
injuries
,
the
lawsuit
claims
.
Other
calls
reported
evidence
that
Adrian
was
being
beaten
and
choked
by
his
father
and
stepmother
.
One
hotline
caller
said
Adrian
had
been
spanked
to
the
point
where
his
buttocks
were
bleeding
.
Adrian
eventually
underwent
treatment
for
disruptive
behavior
and
``
parent-child
relationship
problem
,
''
the
lawsuit
states
.
His
father
and
stepmother
reported
that
Adrian
frequently
wet
the
bed
,
stole
and
hoarded
food
,
picked
at
sores
and
lit
fires
-
characteristics
that
the
lawsuit
says
are
common
in
young
victims
of
child
abuse
.
The
family
temporarily
moved
to
Missouri
,
where
hotline
calls
continued
-
one
caller
reporting
that
Adrian
's
stepmother
would
beat
``
the
living
daylights
out
of
the
kids
for
no
reason
''
and
would
sell
``
meth
''
out
of
the
home
,
the
lawsuit
stated
.
Records
show
that
Adrian
himself
opened
up
about
the
abuse
to
child
welfare
workers
.
In
a
July
2013
interview
with
a
Missouri
Children
's
Division
worker
and
a
police
officer
,
Adrian
-
then
age
5
-
said
his
father
would
kick
him
so
violently
in
the
back
of
his
head
that
a
``
little
bone
come
out
,
''
the
Kansas
City
Star
reported
.
``
My
daddy
keeps
hitting
me
in
the
head
and
punches
me
in
the
stomach
and
my
mom
keeps
pulling
on
my
ears
and
it
really
hurts
,
''
Adrian
said
.
``
Mommy
and
Daddy
lock
me
in
my
room
by
myself
.
Mommy
and
Daddy
ca
n't
feed
me
.
''
On
another
occasion
,
Adrian
told
a
case
worker
that
he
was
forced
to
stand
in
the
corner
and
do
jumping
jacks
and
push-ups
all
day
.
For
a
period
of
several
months
in
2014
,
Adrian
was
placed
in
a
residential
treatment
center
in
Grandview
,
Missouri
,
having
been
diagnosed
with
post-
traumatic
stress
disorder
.
He
was
discharged
on
Sept.
4
,
2014
,
on
the
condition
that
his
father
and
stepmother
follow
an
``
aftercare
plan
,
''
including
enrollment
in
school
and
therapy
.
The
center
did
not
follow
up
with
Adrian
after
he
was
discharged
,
the
lawsuit
alleges
.
A
month
later
,
Adrian
's
stepmother
emailed
the
boy
's
therapist
at
the
treatment
center
,
saying
Adrian
was
``
getting
to
be
too
much
all
over
again
.
''
Leading
up
to
the
boy
's
death
,
his
stepmother
,
Heather
Jones
,
often
posted
angry
rants
about
Adrian
on
a
private
Facebook
page
,
and
alluded
to
wanting
to
kill
him
,
according
to
an
affidavit
obtained
by
the
Kansas
City
Star
.
On
Christmas
Day
2014
,
the
stepmother
made
a
reference
to
wanting
to
simulate
an
episode
of
``
The
Walking
Dead
''
in
which
a
character
shoots
a
child
in
the
back
of
the
head
.
Three
days
later
,
Heather
Jones
posted
that
she
``
might
be
the
next
(
redacted
)
and
have
to
feed
some
pigs
a
body
.
''
Just
over
a
year
after
Adrian
was
discharged
from
the
residential
treatment
center
,
he
died
.
At
Adrian
's
father
's
sentencing
hearing
,
a
detective
nearly
broke
down
in
tears
during
his
remarks
,
the
Kansas
City
Star
recounted
.
He
said
the
torture
Adrian
went
through
was
unlike
anything
he
had
seen
in
more
than
two
decades
in
law
enforcement
.
The
detective
,
Stuart
Littlefield
,
recalled
how
Adrian
was
shocked
with
a
stun
gun
by
his
stepmother
.
Littlefield
paused
his
words
for
20
seconds
-
demonstrating
how
long
the
shocks
would
sometimes
last
.
``
Imagine
the
screams
of
a
7-year-old
boy
,
''
the
detective
said
.
``
Twenty
seconds
is
a
very
long
time
when
you
're
in
agony
.
''

A
58-year-old
Hammond
man
w
as
killed
Friday
night
after
being
struck
by
a
vehicle
while
crossing
Calumet
A
venue
at
Gostlin
Street
,
officials
said
.
James
Gavina
,
58
,
of
the
4500
block
of
Oak
Avenue
,
died
from
blunt
force
trauma
injuries
,
according
to
a
press
release
from
the
Lake
County
Coroner
's
Office
.
He
was
pronounced
dead
at
9:04
p.m.
No
other
details
were
available
.
Hammond
police
could
not
be
immediately
reached
Saturday
morning
.

A
convicted
drunk
driver
is
facing
multiple
charges
after
allegedly
passing
out
behind
the
wheel
early
Monday
at
a
train
crossing
in
west
suburban
Riverside
.
An
officer
responded
about
3:15
a.m.
to
a
call
of
a
disabled
driver
who
had
been
traveling
south
in
the
3300
block
of
South
Harlem
near
the
Burlington
Northern
Railroad
Crossing
,
according
to
Riverside
police
.
When
the
officer
arrived
,
the
driver
’
s
car
hadn
’
t
moved
after
the
train
cleared
the
intersection
and
the
gates
went
up
.
The
officer
then
found
the
driver
with
his
head
slumped
on
the
steering
wheel
with
the
car
running
and
his
foot
on
the
brake
,
police
said
.
After
knocking
and
pounding
on
the
car
’
s
window
,
the
officer
opened
the
door
and
shook
the
driver
to
wake
him
.
The
officer
immediately
noticed
a
strong
odor
of
alcohol
coming
from
the
driver
and
the
car
.
The
driver
’
s
speech
was
also
slurred
and
his
eyes
were
bloodshot
.
Following
a
failed
field
sobriety
test
,
Ruben
Quintana
was
taken
into
custody
,
police
said
.
Quintana
,
33
,
of
Stickney
,
then
handed
over
a
United
State
’
s
passport
after
being
asked
for
his
driver
’
s
license
,
which
he
explained
was
invalid
.
After
being
taken
to
the
Riverside
police
station
,
Quintana
refused
to
participate
in
testing
to
determine
is
blood-alcohol
level
,
police
said
.
During
an
investigation
,
it
was
revealed
that
he
had
a
record
of
drunk
driving
,
including
a
2013
arrest
in
Riverside
,
and
a
2011
DUI
conviction
in
Kansas
.
Quintana
was
charged
with
misdemeanor
counts
of
driving
under
the
influence
of
alcohol
,
improper
parking
on
roadway
,
driving
with
no
valid
driver
’
s
license
and
no
vehicle
insurance
,
police
said
.
The
Cook
County
state
’
s
attorney
’
s
office
declined
Riverside
police
’
s
request
for
an
enhanced
felony
drunk
driving
charge
.
“
To
think
that
Mr.
Quintana
had
been
arrested
by
my
agency
in

for
the
exact
same
crime
involving
the
exact
same
circumstances
where
he
had
passed
out
behind
the
wheel
in
the
middle
of
traffic
is
really
inconceivable
,
”
Riverside
police
Chief
Tom
Weitzel
said
in
a
statement
.
“
Taking
into
consideration
he
had
an
out-
of-state
Kansas
DUI
conviction
,
I
do
not
understand
why
the
Cook
County
State

s
Attorney
did
not
enhance
the
charge
to
a
felony
drunk
driving
.
”

the

A

morning
in

10:45
a.m.
,
two
males
were
arguing
in

in
the

shot
,
according

.
The
39-year-old

,
police

Chicago
Police
on
Tuesday
touted
the
least-violent
Labor
Day
weekend
in
three
years
,
and
the
arrest
of
an
alleged
gun-runner
who
trafficked
“
hundreds
”
of
weapons—
including
assault
rifles—
from
Arkansas
to
street
gangs
on
the
South
and
West
sides
.
The
alleged
gun-trafficker
was
arrested
Sunday
in
Chicago
Ridge
during
an
exchange
of
eight
weapons
for
$
7,000
,
Chief
Anthony
Riccio
of
the
Organized
Crime
Division
said
at
a
news
conference
at
CPD
headquarters
.
A
federal
criminal
complaint
filed
Tuesday
stated
that
Klint
Kelley
,
of
Malvern
,
Ark.
,
sold
21
guns
to
a
confidential
informant
in
three
buys
staged
between
April
and
the
weekend
’
s
bust
,
apparently
timing
the
deals
with
visits
to
family
in
the
Chicago
suburbs
.
Kelley
is
expected
to
appear
in
federal
court
in
Chicago
this
afternoon
,
according
to
Joseph
Fitzgerald
,
spokesman
for
the
U.S.
Attorney
’
s
Office
.
The
arrest
was
the
culmination
of
a
four-month
sting
operation
targeting
the
gun
trafficker
,
who
Riccio
said
had
“
ties
”
to
Chicago
gangs
,
but
lived
in
Arkansas
,
where
he
purchased
weapons
at
gun
shows
and
online
,
but
did
not
fill
out
paperwork
that
would
have
listed
him
as
the
purchaser
.
“
He
was
pretty
slick
about
it
,
”
Riccio
said
.
“
He
would
never
do
the
ownership
paperwork
because
he
[
knew
they
]
ultimately
would
be
used
for
crimes
in
the
city
of
Chicago.
”
Sun-Times
statistics
show
seven
people
were
killed
and
another
37
wounded
from
Friday
night
through
Monday
night
.
Last
year
,
13
people
were
killed
and
52
wounded
during
the
same
span
.
First
Deputy
Supt
.
Kevin
Navarro
said
officers
seized
more
than
100
guns
during
the
80
hours
between
Friday
night
to
Monday
,
bettering
the
usual
rate
of
one
gun
per
hour
the
department
averages
on
a
typical
day
.
Navarro
credited
the
presence
of
1,300
additional
officers
on
the
streets
over
the
long
weekend
,
and
the
department
’
s
new
Strategic
Decision
Support
Centers
with
helping
commanders
figure
out
where
to
dispatch
the
extra
bodies
to
head
off
violence
.
After
a
shooting
Sunday
,
Area
North
commanders
were
able
to
compile
data
in
the
area
’
s
“
Hunch
Lab
”
data
base
and
determine
that
there
was
a
conflagration
between
gangs
in
the
neighborhood
,
and
that
deploying
extra
officers
for
traffic
enforcement
and
more
visible
patrols
might
suppress
more
gunplay
,
department
spokesman
Anthony
Guglielmi
said
.
Soon
after
the
shooting
,
officers
conducting
traffic
enforcement
pulled
over
a
car
and
found
one
of
the
occupants
had
an
illegal
handgun
.
The
offender
was
charged
with
a
felony
and
two
other
passengers
in
the
car
are
being
questioned
as
“
persons
of
interest
”
in
the
shooting
,
Guglielmi
said
.
In
a
bid
to
tamp
down
violence
,
CPD
officers
also
rounded
up
more
than
100
people
identified
as
possible
participants
in
violence
on
Thursday
and
Friday
.
But
additional
manpower
and
pre-weekend
arrests
have
been
standard
practice
for
CPD
over
summer
holiday
weekends
for
years
,
and
the
tactics
have
shown
mixed
success
:
Memorial
Day
weekend
was
less
violent
this
year
than
2016
,
but
the
July
4
weekend
saw
14
people
killed
and
87
wounded
in
shootings
.

confronted
the
Samson
and
then
was
pistol-whipped
.
During
an
altercation
,
the
gunman
shot
himself
.
Aaron
said
it
was
unclear

the
time
of
the
shooting
,
and
that
all

had
just
walked
across
the
street
to
deliver
a

thief
jumped
into
her
car
and
drove
off
,
headed
west
on
Cortland
Street
before
turning
south
on
Hoyne

.
She

late
20s
,
tall
and
thin
and
wearing
black
pants

navy
sweatshirt
.
He
did
n't
say
anything
when
he
pulled
on
her
lanyard
,
she
said
.

I
thought
about
taking
my
cane
and
hitting
the
front
windshield
and
trying
to
stand
in
front
of
the
car
,
but
I
stopped
.
It
's
not
worth
it
,
''
the
woman
said
,
adding
,
``
It
all
happened
so
fast

The
necklace
contained
her
car
keys

a
plastic

declined
medical
attention
when

The
woman
and
her
husband
had
just
bought
the

past
Monday

been
sideswiped

August
.
``
[
The
new
car
]
had
105
miles
on
it
and
a
full
tank
of
gas
.
I
think
I
'm
more
upset
about
that
.
I
'm
sure
it
's
going
to
be
found
.
I
do
n't
doubt
that
for
a
minute
.
I
do
n't
know
what
condition
it
will
be
in
,
I
hope
they
do
n't
drive
it
into
a
wall
,

she
said

12:33
p.m.

My
first
reaction
to
most
things
I
learn
is
either
curiosity
or
its
cousin
,
healthy
skepticism
.
So
imagine
my
reaction
when
I
opened
the
Wrestling
Observer
newsletter
to
read
Bobby
``
The
Brain
''
Heenan
's
obituary
and
found
these
words
:
``
Once
,
in
Chicago
,
a
fan
fired
several
shots
at
him
.
Because
of
that
,
Heenan
was
also
quick
to
argue
with
people
who
would
say
that
the
old
days
were
better
,
noting
he
made
more
money
with
far
less
danger
as
time
went
on
.
''
Immediately
,
I
needed
to
learn
more
about
the
shooting
,
which
turned
out
to
be
one
of
those
``
only
in
wrestling
''
kind
of
stories
.
But
first
,
it
's
important
to
understand
that
pro
wrestling
is
a
vehicle
for
allegories
and
entertainment
,
like
all
theater
.
The
point
of
watching
men
strip
to
their
underwear
and
pretend
to
fight
is
knowing
it
's
a
melodrama
—
but
engaging
with
it
anyway
.
Every
wrestling
fan
has
been
teased
at
some
point
by
friends
who
ask
,
``
You
know
it
's
fake
,
right
?
''
And
the
answer
for
almost
all
of
us
is
``
yes
.
''
Sometimes
I
quote
the
great
wrestler
[
Mick
Foley
]
[
2
]
back
at
people
:
``
The
real
world
is
faker
than
wrestling
.
''
Like
when
I
watch
cable
newscasters
verbally
bodyslam
strawmen
or
see
a
web
link
to
a
clearly
partisan
website
get
regurgitated
as
fact
on
Facebook
.
Unlike
real
life
,
where
we
need
critical
thinking
skills
more
than
ever
to
distinguish
fake
news
from
reality
,
wrestling
is
supposed
to
be
about
accepting
what
you
see
and
having
fun
with
it
.
That
's
a
big
part
of
the
appeal
,
and
also
what
made
the
incident
at
an
American
Wrestling
Association
show
on
Jan.
25
,
1975
,
especially
intriguing
.
The
AWA
came
to
Chicago
at
the
International
Amphitheatre
on
Halsted
that
night
and
five
people
were
shot
,
one
critically
,
by
an
angry
fan
who
was
upset
at
Bobby
Heenan
,
according
to
a
Jan.
27
,
1975
,
Chicago
Tribune
report
.
Heenan
was
a
Chicago
native
who
backed
legends
including
Andre
the
Giant
,
[
Ric
Flair
]
[
3
]
and
Nick
Bockwinkel
as
they
battled
with
Hulk
Hogan
and
Verne
Gagne
.
No
one
really
disputes
that
Heenan
,
who
also
went
by
``
Weasel
''
and
``
Pretty
Boy
,
''
was
the
greatest
manager
in
wrestling
history
and
also
one
of
the
industry
's
best
commentators
.
As
a
performer
,
Heenan
had
the
ability
to
get
under
fans
'
skin
so
they
would
want
to
see
his
wrestler
get
beat
—
helping
draw
countless
people
to
arenas
.
The
Tribune
story
about
that
night
cites
a
36-year-old
truck
driver
identified
by
the
pseudonym
``
Wayne
Polski
''
as
its
main
source
.
In
this
story
,
as
told
by
Polski
,
the
gunman
himself
resembles
some
sort
of
wrestling
character
.
Polski
described
the
shooter
as
``
all
slicked
up
like
one
of
those
dude
pimps
.
''
During
the
main
event
,
the
fan
became
upset
when
Heenan
—
who
managed
Bockwinkel
—
interfered
.
``
He
kept
screaming
to
get
Bobby
Heenan
out
of
there
,
''
Polski
told
the
Tribune
.
Thinking
Bockwinkel
would
unfairly
get
the
win
,
the
man
opened
fire
,
he
said
.
None
of
the
reports
I
found
clearly
explained
all
the
facts
,
and
when
I
asked
Chicago
Police
for
information
on
the
incident
,
they
essentially
said
I
'm
out
of
luck
without
a
victim
's
name
.
Real
?
Fake
?
Half-true
?
For
some
reason
,
I
had
to
know
.
I
reached
out
to
six
wrestlers
who
are
still
alive
and
wrestled
on
the
card
that
night
to
ask
for
their
memories
.
One
could
n't
recall
the
incident
but
another
,
Rock
Riddle
,
emailed
back
to
say
he
'd
left
after
his
match
for
a
444-mile
drive
back
to
his
temporary
home
in
Brooklyn
Park
,
Minn.
About
20
minutes
into
the
drive
,
Riddle
said
,
he
heard
the
news
on
the
radio
:
``
Someone
shot
at
the
guys
,
missed
,
and
hit
several
fans
at
ringside
.
''
Riddle
said
his
perception
of
the
incident
,
from
talking
to
Heenan
and
peers
,
differed
slightly
from
the
Tribune
's
:
``
There
was
a
guy
up
in
the
cheap
seats
with
a
gun
.
He
...
shot
at
the
'bad
guys
'
in
the
ring
.
He
missed
,
but
he
hit
''
several
people
.
Anyone
who
knows
pro
wrestling
wo
n't
be
surprised
by
what
Riddle
said
his
thoughts
were
upon
hearing
the
news
:
``
There
wo
n't
be
anybody
at
next
month
's
matches
''
in
Chicago
.
``
And
,
of
course
,
with
the
wrestlers
'
sense
of
humor
,
it
did
n't
take
long
before
everyone
was
second-guessing
...
how
to
use
the
shooting
to
fill
the
arena
the
following
month
,
''
Riddle
said
.
That
's
definitely
dark
,
but
as
Riddle
put
it
,
``
when
you
risk
your
life
every
night
in
the
brutal
business
of
professional
wrestling
,
you
quickly
develop
an
extreme
sense
of
humor
.
''
Heenan
in
later
years
said
that
the
gunman
``
would
come
back
but
no
one
would
say
'I
saw
him
do
it
,
'
so
they
did
n't
arrest
him
.
But
they
put
police
around
him
to
watch
him
.
''
The
last
line
,
I
think
,
exceeds
most
bounds
of
plausibility
.
Personally
,
I
think
the
whole
story
is
only
partially
true
,
but
what
parts
,
I
still
do
n't
know
.
The
further
I
got
into
fact
finding
,
the
more
I
started
to
ask
whether
the
truth
,
in
this
case
,
even
mattered
.
Pro
wrestling
is
n't
real
life
.
And
for
that
,
I
'm
glad
.
There
are
many
situations
where
it
's
essential
to
glean
just
the
facts
.
For
me
,
in
2017
at
least
,
this
is
n't
one
of
them
.
Even
if
the
old
days
include
tall
tales
stretched
by
time
and
memory
,
I
agree
with
Heenan
:
We
're
better
off
in
a
day
where
people
take
other
things
more
seriously
than
wrestling
.

CHICAGO
—
The
number
of
homicides
in
Chicago
in
October
was
significantly
lower
than
during
October
2016
,
but
2017
still
will
be
one
of
the
most
violent
years
in
recent
memory
for
the
city
.
The
Chicago
Police
Department
said
Wednesday
that
53
homicides
occurred
in
October
compared
to
80
in
October
2016
.
It
said
228
shooting
incidents
happened
last
month
compared
to
353
in
October
of
last
year
.
The
total
homicide
count
for
the
year
is
570
so
far
.
The
city
had
631
killings
by
this
time
last
year
.
Chicago
,
which
is
the

this
year
compared
to
3,000
by
this
time
last
year
,
department
statistics
show
.
It
's
unlikely
that
2017
will
end
with
762
Chicago
homicides
as
it
did
in
2016
.
The
762
killings
was
the
highest
total
for
the
city
since
1997
and
more
than
the
combined
2016
totals
of
Los
Angeles
and
New
York
City
.
However
,
Chicago
is
almost
certain
to
pass
the
600
mark
for
homicides
for
just
the
second
time
in
14
years
.
And
with
two
months
left
in
the
year
,
the
number
of
shooting
incidents
has
already
eclipsed
the
total
for
all
of
2015
.
Police
said
some
of
the
drop
for
October
can
be
attributed
to
an
expanded
use
of
technology
that
helps
officers
respond
to
shootings
more
quickly
and
better
identify
areas
where
violence
might
occur
.
They
said
they
are
encouraged
by
the
fact
that
there
are
fewer
shooting
incidents
in
18
of
the
22
police
districts
compared
to
last
year
.
They
also
point
out
that
in
seven
of
those
districts
—
including
a
historically
violent
district
on
the
city
's
South
Side
—
the
number
of
shooting
incidents
is
lower
than
during
the
same
period
in
2015
.
``
This
is
certainly
not
victory
,
''
Police
Superintendent
Eddie
Johnson
said
in
a
statement
,
``
but
it
is
significant
progress
in
the
right
direction
.

Today
's
[
Google
Doodle
]
[
25
]
features
a
colorful
and
lively
ode
to
pad
thai
,
easily
Thailand
's
most
famous
dish
.
The
seven-panel
illustration
goes
through
the
basic
steps
of
the
recipe
,
while
also
offering
a
brief
history
.
But
as
Peter
Meehan
,
editor
of
the
dearly
departed
Lucky
Peach
magazine
,
wrote
in
“
101
Easy
Asian
Recipes
”
cookbook
,
``
The
internet
,
as
you
well
know
,
is
propped
up
by
two
things
:
pornography
and
easy
renditions
of
pad
thai
.
Neither
simulacrum
is
as
exciting
as
the
real
thing
.
''
To
be
clear
,
when
done
right
,
pad
thai
is
a
fascinating
mixture
of
stir-fried
noodles
in
a
distinct
tamarind-based
sauce
,
which
tastes
sweet
,
sour
,
funky
,
nutty
and
spicy
.
It
really
is
a
marvel
.
But
when
pad
thai
is
done
wrong
,
you
end
up
with
a
gooey
pile
of
sweet
noodles
with
some
peanuts
tossed
on
top
.
Sadly
,
my
experience
eating
the
dish
around
Chicago
confirms
that
the
latter
is
far
more
prevalent
than
the
former
,
though
a
few
places
serve
admirable
versions
,
like
Ravenswood
’
s
Aroy
Thai
and
Rosded
in
Lincoln
Square
.
You
can
see
what
I
mean
by
remembering
your
last
takeout
container
of
pad
thai
and
comparing
that
to
the
stunningly
beautiful
plate
assembled
by
Leela
Punyaratabandhu
on
her
Thai
recipe
site
,
[
She
Simmers
]
[
26
]
.
Her
intense
examination
of
the
dish
took
her
five
long
blog
posts
,
20
ingredients
and
a
good
chunk
of
time
to
complete
.
It
's
no
wonder
why
most
places
do
n't
serve
a
credible
version
.
Of
course
,
I
distinctly
remember
my
first
plate
of
pad
thai
,
which
was
probably
overly
sweet
and
a
little
gloopy
,
but
still
thrilling
to
my
younger
palate
.
And
that
's
why
I
like
to
think
of
most
pad
thai
as
an
excellent
gateway
dish
to
the
wonders
of
Thai
cuisine
.
Fortunately
,
Chicago
is
packed
with
incredible
Thai
restaurants
,
including
Andy
's
Thai
Kitchen
,
Rainbow
Cuisine
,
Sticky
Rice
,
Tac
Quick
and
Arun
's
,
where
you
can
find
stunningly
complex
curries
,
insanely
spicy
papaya
salads
,
and
some
of
the
crunchiest
and
juiciest
fried
chicken
around
.

Media
Wire
)
-
A
man
was
charged
early
Tuesday
morning
with
driving
under
the
influence
of
Xanax
and
marijuana
in
west
suburban
Riverside
,
but
thought
he
was
in
Canada
during
the
time
of
his
arrest
.
An
officer
on
patrol
at
4:26
a.m.
spotted
a
2011
Mitsubishi
convertible
speeding
northbound
on
Harlem
Avenue
from
East
Burlington
Street
,
according
to
a
statement
from
Riverside
police
.
The
convertible
was
weaving
in
and
out
of
traffic
while
going
70
mph
in
a
30
mph
zone
,
police
said
.
The
officer
stopped
the
driver
,
identified
as
20-year-old
Ibrahim
Hodzic
,
on
Ogden
and
Hass
avenues
.
The
officer
detected
a
strong
scent
of
marijuana
coming
from
inside
the
car
and
asked
Hodzic
to
get
out
,
police
said
.
He
then
stumbled
onto
the
street
and
failed
a
sobriety
test
.
Hodzic
told
the
officer
he
had
taken
Xanax
and
smoked
marijuana
before
driving
,
police
said
.
Hodzic
believed
he
was
in
Canada
at
the
time
of
his
arrest
.
Hodzic
,
of
Forest
Park
,
was
charged
with
two
counts
of
drugged
driving
,
felony
possession
of
a
controlled
substance
,
aggravated
speeding
,
illegal
lane
usage
and
possession

cited
for
cannabis
possession

-
Santa
Claus
may
be
coming
to
town
,
but
you
'll
need
a
reservation
to
see
him
.
At
Macy
's
flagship
store
on
34th

in
New
York
,
a
chance
to
sit
on
Saint

and
make
it
easier

see
the
man
in
the
red
suit
.
``
Santa

especially
on
our
busiest
days
,
''
the

said
.
Santaland
is
a
13,000-square-foot

The
department
store

be
sure
to
check
in
with
an
elf
when
arriving
.
``
Santa

day
is
packed
!
To
help
keep
him
on

WIRE

\-
A
SWAT
team
was
called
Tuesday
evening
in
for
an
intoxicated
man
who
barricaded
himself
inside
an
Englewood
neighborhood
home
on
the
South
Side
.
Officers
arrived
about
5:15
p.m.
to
the
home
in
the
7000
block
of
South
Throop
,
according
to
Chicago
Police
.
The
man
barricaded
himself
in
the
home
and
was
possibly
armed
with
a
weapon
,
police
said
.
He
was
eventually
peacefully
brought
out
of
the
home
and
taken
to
St.
Bernard
Hospital
for
a
mental
evaluation
,
police
said
.
No
injuries
were
reported
.

A
woman
said
a
group
of
thieves
stole
all
of
the
tires
and
rims
off
her
car
in
the
Jefferson
Park
neighborhood
on
Friday
.
Amy
Crespo
is
a

help
her
sons
get
ready
for
school
,
she
said
one

“
They
should
get
a

”
she

Well
,
not
when
it
's
a
list
of
states
sorted
by
people
fleeing
the
state
.
And
that
's
the
list
contained
in
[
United
Van
Lines
'
National
Movers
Study
]
[
22
]
,
released
last
month
,
where
they
calculate
the
percentage
of
total
moves
that
are
from
the
state
(
as
opposed
to
to
the
state
)
.
They
do
this
once
a
year
and
this
year
Illinois
is
at
the
top
of
this
infamous
list
.
63.4
%
of
the
moves
involved
people
leaving
the
state
,
compared
to
only
32.3
%
leaving
Vermont
.
Bernie
Sanders
must
be
a
huge
Vermont
draw
.
The
dynamic
map
below
shows
which
states
are
attracting
people
(
blue
)
and
which
states
are
repelling
people
(
yellow
)
at
5
year
increments
.
Darker
yellow
means
a
higher
percentage
of
people
leaving
and
darker
blue
means
a
higher
percentage
of
people
arriving
.
Gray
is
balanced
.
The
general
trend
for
2017
was
people
leaving
the
midwest
and
going
to
the
northwest
and
southeast
.
I
'm
really
surprised
that
Texas
does
n't
have
more
people
moving
in
,
given
it
's
economic
growth
.
In
looking
at
the
5
year
increments
below
you
can
see
that
Illinois
has
a
proud
tradition
of
losing
people
going
back
37
years
.
It
should
be
noted
that
this
data
is
based
solely
upon
moves
handled
by
United
Van
Lines
so
it
does
n't
really
qualify
as
a
scientific
study
but
they
are
a
large
mover
and
they
should
be
relatively
representative
of
the
truth
.
According
to
Michael
Stoll
,
economist
and
professor
in
the
Department
of
Public
Policy
at
the
University
of
California
,
Los
Angeles
:
>
This
year
’
s
data
reflects
longer-term
trends
of
movement
to
the
western
and
southern
states
,
especially
to
those
where
housing
costs
are
relatively
lower
,
climates
are
more
temperate
and
job
growth
has
been
at
or
above
the
national
average
,
among
other
factors
.
We
’
re
also
seeing
continued
migration
to
the
Pacific
Northwest
and
Mountain
West
as
young
professionals
and
retirees
leave
California
.
Yep
.
California
is
a
killer
with
it
's
high
housing
prices
,
high
taxes
,
droughts
,
mudslides
,
earthquakes
,
and
forest
fires
.
But
it
's
a
great
place
to
visit
.
As
you
would
expect
,
the
main
reasons
people
have
given
for
moving
is
jobs
,
retirement
,
and
being
closer
to
family
.

Authorities
are
asking
the
public
for
information
after
shots
were
fired
Thursday
night
in
west
suburban
Aurora
.
A
newer-model
black
SUV
was
chasing
a
white
or
silver
car
at
9:35
p.m.
near
Melrose
Avenue
and
Lafayette
Street
when
someone
in
the
SUV
shot
at
the
car
,
according
to
a
statement
from
Aurora
police
.
No
one
appeared
to
have
been
shot
,
but
a
parked
pickup
truck
in
the
1000
block
of
Lafayette
was
hit
by
gunfire
multiple
times
,
police
said
.
Anyone
with
information
is
asked
to
call
investigators
at
(
630
)
256-5500
or
Aurora
Area
Crime
Stoppers
at
(
630
)
892-1000
.

When
one
thinks
of
Wrigleyville
,
it
’
s
likely
that
the
first
thoughts
that
result
are
not
“
craft
cocktails
”
or
“
vintage
spirits
”
–more
like
cheap
beer
and
game
day
shenanigans
.
But
Mordecai
(
3632
N.
Clark
,
Lakeview
)
,
the
new
cocktail
bar
and
restaurant
coming
to
[
the
Hotel
Zachary
]
[
1
]
this
week
,
aims
to
change
that
in
a
big
way
.
“
Wrigleyville
has
a
certain
perception
that
,
these
days
,
is
not
totally
accurate
,
”
says
chef/owner
Matthias
Merges
,
who
is
also
the
man
behind
[
Billy
Sunday
]
[
2
]
and
[
A10
]
[
3
]
.
“
The
perception
is
of
those
22-year-olds
in
dive-y
bars
.
But
more
and
more
,
there
is
a
contingent
of
people
who
live
in
this
area
who
are
more
demanding
.
I
think
we
’
re
responding
to
that
need
.
”
Mordecai
is
a
glittering
two-story
space
,
with
more
than
100
seats
and
a
secluded
upstairs
bar
.
The
original
inspiration
was
Billy
Sunday
,
a
bar
that
does
complex
,
spirit-forward
cocktails
with
a
hefty
dose
of
Chicago
history
and
a
huge
collection
of
vintage
spirits
.
“
[
The
developers
]
loved
the
story
behind
Billy
Sunday
,
and
how
we
curated
that
story
and
history
,
and
we
wand
to
do
the
same
thing
here
,
which
is
how
we
came
up
with
Mordecai
,
”
said
Merges
.
The
name
refers
to
famous
Cubs
pitcher
Mordecai
Brown
,
who
helped
the
Cubs
win
two
World
Series
and
stood
up
to
the
mob
when
asked
to
throw
a
big
game
.
(
He
was
also
known
by
the
nickname
Three
Finger
,
as
he
lost
a
finger
in
a
childhood
accident
and
suffered
from
paralysis
in
another
finger
on
his
pitching
hand
.
)
The
food
,
from
chef
[
Jared
Wentworth
]
[
4
]
(
formerly
of
Longman
&
amp
;
Eagle
,
Dusek
’
s
,
and
Prairie
School
)
focuses
on
recognizable
dishes
with
a
few
elevated
twists
.
After
all
,
it
’
s
still
next
to
a
baseball
stadium
.
There
are
takes
on
fish
and
chips
,
roast
chicken
,
and
grilled
hanger
steak
,
but
also
a
few
surprises
,
like
a
beet
tartare
with
celery
root
and
a
Middle
Eastern-inspired
grilled
octopus
with
chickpeas
,
ramps
,
and
harissa
.
Merges
called
the
approach
to
the
menu
at
Mordecai
his
“
70/30
”
rule
.
“
When
you
come
in
and
sit
down
and
look
at
the
menu
,
the
terms
are
recognizable
,
the
preps
are
recognizable
,
and
then
we
give
you
30
percent
of
things
that
are
not
,
”
he
says
.
“
It
’
s
those
things
that
make
something
memorable.
”
The
cocktail
program
is
a
huge
focus
,
but
so
is
the
spirits
list
.
Any
Billy
Sunday
fan
knows
that
that
bar
has
a
massive
menu
of
vintage
amaro
kept
in
a
leather-bound
book
;
at
Mordecai
,
the
focus
is
bourbon
and
scotch
.
Especially
at
the
smaller
upstairs
bar
,
guests
will
find
old
bottles
that
won
’
t
be
encountered
anywhere
else
,
including
bourbon
going
back
to
the
1930s
.
It
’
s
going
to
be
an
interesting
challenge
running
a
restaurant
operating
at
this
high
a
level
when
40,000
people
crowd
into
the
neighborhood
,
but
Merges
is
already
anticipating
;
they
’
re
working
on
a
game
day
menu
that
’
s
a
little
easier
to
execute
.
And
they
hope
to
create
a
spot
that
’
s
a
destination
even
when
the
Cubs
aren
’
t
at
home
.
