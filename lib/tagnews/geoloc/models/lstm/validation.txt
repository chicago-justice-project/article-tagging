``
It
's
pretty
old

pretty
significant
that
we
were
able
to
bring
her
in
,
''
said
Sgt
.
Sara
Balmes
of
the
Lake

.
She
did
not
know
if
it
was
the

another
woman
for
allegedly
committing
a
home

Lizeth
Dominguez

by
telling
the
residents
they
were
lead

They
threatened
the
residents
with
knives
,
bound
them
with
duct
tape
and
took
$
2,000

Gurnee
,
was
believed
to
be
with
Lopez
in
El

,
which
has
no

treaty
with
the
United

He
was
not

AUSTIN
—
Police
are
asking
residents
to
be
on
the
lookout
after
a
group
of
young
men
committed
a
string
of
armed
robberies
around
the
Austin
neighborhood
early
Friday
morning
,
according
to
a
Saturday
community
alert
.
Between
midnight
and
6:10
a.m.
,
police
said
,
a
group
of
four-to-six
people
between
the
ages
of
14
and
23
jumped
out
of
a
silver
or
white
Chevrolet
Malibu
and
robbed
people
at
gunpoint
in
the
following
blocks
:
•
The
100
block
of
South
Menard

at
12
a.m

at

An
off-duty
Chicago
police
officer
exchanged
gunfire
with
two
armed
robbers
early
Monday
after
one
of
the
gunmen
told
the
other
to
shoot
the
cop
,
authorities
said
.
The
officer
,
49
,
was
hit
in
the
leg
,
and
one
of
the
robbers
may
also
have
been
wounded
in
the
shootout
,
according
to
interim
police
Superintendent
John
Escalante
.
Detectives
were
questioning
a
person
who
showed
up
at
Little
Company
of
Mary
Hospital
shortly
after
the
shooting
with
a
gunshot
wound
,
Escalante
said
.
Due
to
the
timing
,
police
believe
he
may
be
the
person
shot
by
the
officer
.
The
officer
was
parking
his
car
near
his
home
in
the
10100
block
of
South
Green
Street
in
the
Washington
Heights
neighborhood
around
2:20
a.m.
when
the
two
gunmen
walked
up
on
either
side
and
announced
a
robbery
,
Escalante
said
outside
Advocate
Christ
Medical
Center
in
Oak
Lawn
,
where
the
officer
was
being
treated
.
``
The
officer
was
very
concerned
at
that
point
because
they
obviously
did
n't
know
he
was
a
police
officer
and
he
was
very
concerned
that
once
they
realized
he
was
a
police
officer
that
they
might
immediately
shoot
,

Escalante
said

In
the
early
1970s
Edward
Williams
began
buying
racist
images
.
He
bought
every
one
he
came
across
.
He
bought
so
many
that
his
wife
began
to
complain
about
the
clutter
:
What
was
he
planning
to
do
with
all
of
this
racist
stuff
?
Sell
it
?
Save
it
?
Many
of
his
finds
were
tchotchkes
—
racist
tea
cozies
,
racist
candles
,
racist
ceramic
figurines
—
but
soon
he
ran
out
of
room
to
store
new
racist
objects
and
switched
to
flatter
paper
items
.
Racist
children
's
books
,
sheet
music
.
At
the
time
Williams
was
an
executive
at
Harris
Bank
.
The
first
black
man
to
work
for
the
company
,
he
had
grown
up
on
the
South
Side
,
above
Lang
's
Bar
B
Que
on
South
Prairie
;
his
mother
cleaned
homes
and
his
father
was
a
welder
.
Williams
was
at
Harris
for
40
years
,
moving
up
the
ranks
from
teller
supervisor
to
vice
president
.
When
he
retired
in
2004
,
he
was
a
trustee
at
the
[
Art
Institute
of
Chicago
]
[
38
]
.
The
day
he
started
gathering
racist
ephemera
he
was
n't
planning
on
it
.
He
was
browsing
an
antique
store
in
central
Indiana
and
noticed
a
small
card
in
a
gold
frame
.
``
I
saw
it
from
the
corner
of
my
eye
,
''
he
said
.
``
A
caricature
of
a
black
man
in
a
white
clown
costume
,
made
to
look
grotesque
.
It
sent
chills
down
my
spine
.
I
was
taken
aback
and
I
had
to
get
out
of
there
.
But
I
also
could
n't
stop
thinking
about
it
,
so
I
decided
I
had
to
buy
it
—
so
that
no
one
else
could
see
it
.
I
decided
that
I
wanted
it
out
of
circulation
.
''
At
first
his
mission
was
clear
:
He
traveled
the
country
as
a
kind
of
hobby
,
hitting
every
antique
and
memorabilia
store
he
came
across
,
removing
from
circulation
every
derogatory
doll
,
postcard
and
whatnot
he
found
.
``
But
because
of
the
range
and
depth
of
this
stuff
,
that
was
n't
realistic
.
I
did
n't
have
enough
money
to
save
the
world
.
''
So
he
became
discerning
,
an
early
aficionado
of
what
many
collectors
,
black
and
white
,
call
``
negrobilia
,
''
19th
and
20th
century
memorabilia
,
often
prosaic
,
casually
racist
items
.
Williams
and
his
wife
,
Ana
,
had
a
system
:
They
would
enter
a
store
,
he
would
take
one
aisle
,
she
would
take
another
aisle
,
then
they
would
sweep
the
shelves
,
meeting
in
the
back
.
Soon
collectors
recognized
them
,
offering
rarities
stored
beneath
their
counters
.
But
after
more
than
a
decade
,
the
collection
grew
unwieldy
;
once
,
while
trying
to
sell
their
home
,
they
rented
a
temporary
apartment
just
to
remove
the
collection
from
sight
.
They
had
more
than
6,000
pieces
.
When
Williams
retired
,
his
wife
asked
him
to
purge
it
.
So
he
did
.

The
Chicago
area
lost
more
than
[
35,000
black
residents
]
[
6
]
between
2014
to
2015
,
according
to
new
data
from
the
U.S.
Census
Bureau
.
This
stands
as
the
largest
black
exodus
of
any
metropolitan
area
in
the
country
,
according
to
analysis
from
the
Chicago
Tribune
.
This
loss
of
black
residents
led
the
Chicago
metropolitan
statistical
area
,
which
includes
the
city
and
suburbs
stretching
into
Wisconsin
and
Indiana
,
to
its
first
population
loss
in
more
than
two
decades
.
What
’
s
causing
black
families
to
pack
up
and
ship
out
?
A
search
for
safety
and
success
are
likely
suspects
.
**
Black
futures
look
bleak
in
Chicago
**
Chicago
youth
of
color
are
suffering
from
an
unparalleled
drought
of
economic
opportunity
compared
with
peer
cities
,
the
state
of
Illinois
and
the
nation
as
a
whole
,
according
to
a
January
2016
report
titled
“
[
Lost
:
The
Crisis
of
Jobless
and
Out
of
School
Teens
and
Young
Adults
in
Chicago
,
Illinois
and
the
U.S.

[

”
and
prepared
for
the
Alternative
Schools
Network
by
researchers
at
the
University
of
Illinois
at
Chicago
.
Nearly
half
of
Chicago
’
s
young
black
men
ages
20
to
24
are
out
of
school
and
out
of
work
–
a
rate
four
times
higher
than
that
for
white
Chicago
men
in
the
same
age
bracket
,
and
far
higher
than
the
same
groups
in
New
York
City
and
Los
Angeles
.
But
joblessness
doesn
’
t
exist
in
a
vacuum
.
Those
struggling
to
gain
access
to
economic
opportunities
in
Chicago
also
play
a
part
in
the
city
’
s
epidemic
of
violent
crime
.
In
nearly
every
year
between
1991
and
2011
,
the
[
majority
]
[
8
]
of
convicted
murderers
in
Chicago
were
between
the
ages
of
17
and
25
,
according
to
city
crime
data
.
They
were
also
more
likely
to
[
fall
victim
]
[
9
]
to
murder
than
people
in
any
other
age
group
.
But
research
shows
access
to
job
opportunities
[
reduces
violence
]
[
10
]
among
disadvantaged
Chicago
youth
.
University
of
Pennsylvania
criminologist
Sara
Heller
found
that
in
Chicago
,
a
mere
summer
stint
at
a
minimum-wage
job
resulted
in
four
fewer
violent-crime
arrests
per
100
youth
over
16
months
.
It
’
s
unsurprising
then
,
that
jobs
numbers
look
even
worse
in
communities
plagued
with
violent
crime
.

Security
cameras
at
Mash
have
turned
up
an
image
of
the
man
who
business
owners
say
recently
attempted
to
scam
multiple
Lincoln

bars
.
He

the
point

on
the

perhaps
a

walked
into

Daily
Bar

A
37-year-old
Crown
Point
woman
became
the
21st
person
in
Lake
County
to
die
from
an
overdose
Friday
,
a
needle
and
syringe
still
stuck
in
her
arm
,
according
to
the
Lake
County
Coroner
's
office
.
With
21
fatalities
in
the
year
's
first
41
days
,
Lake
County
Coroner
Merrilee
Frey
said
a
heroin
epidemic
is
claiming
an
unprecedented
number
of
lives
.
The
total
confirmed
overdose
deaths
for
January
and
the
entire
month
of
February
last
year
was
18
,
she
said
.
``
Know
that
we
have
many
people
,
hundreds
and
hundreds
in
our
communities
who
have
an
addiction
,
''
Frey
said
.
The
woman
's
death
paints
a
vivid
picture
of
the
problem
that
is
expected
to
get
worse
before
it
gets
better
,
she
said
.
Heroin
and
opioid
overdose
deaths
have
been
on
the
rise
in
recent
years
.
There
were
114
people
who
died
from
drug
overdoses
in
Lake
County
in
2016
.
Frey
fears
the
area
is
at
the
cusp
of
a
spike
in
deaths
.
``
I
'm
hoping
with
all
my
heart
after
seeing
such
as
high
a
number
of
deaths
it
will
make
(
addicts
)
realize
their
own
mortality
,
''
Frey
said
.
Porter
County
Coroner
Chuck
Harris
said
heroin
is
a
problem
in
his
county
as
well
,
though
the
numbers
are
not
as
striking
as
those
seen
in
Lake
County
.
In
2017
,
there
have
been
two
suspected
heroin
overdose
deaths
in
Porter
County
,
though
toxicology
reports
are
pending
,
he
said
.
At
this
point
in
2016
there
were
six
opioid
deaths
--
three
from
heroin
,
one
from
methadone
,
one
from
tramadol
and
one
from
morphine
.
His
office
will
begin
testing
for
fentanyl
this
year
.
Harris
said
in
2016
there
were
48
total
drug-related
deaths
in
Porter
County
.
Of
those
,
20
had
heroin
in
their
systems
and
36
had
some
form
of
opioid
,
which
in
some
cases
in
combination
with
the
heroin
,
he
said
.
Tackling
the
problem
will
take
a
multi-faceted
approach
,
Harris
said
.
``
There
's
no
one
single
answer
,
''
Harris
said
.
``
We
need
treatment
centers
.
We
need
to
get
rid
of
the
stigma
.
People
do
n't
want
to
seek
help
because
they
get
labeled
a
drug
user
.
It
's
a
disease
,
nothing
different
than
any
other
type
of
disease
.
''
Harris
said
studies
routinely
show
the
need
for
long-term
treatment
centers
.
``
Instead
of
keep
looking
at
it
,
we
need
to
actually
do
it
,
''
Harris
said
.
Lake
County
Sheriff
John
Buncich
said
the
trend
is
alarming
and
it
is
getting
worse
.
He
said
the
use
of
fentanyl
in
heroin
is
particularly
troubling
.
Users
do
not
know
what
they
are
buying
and
what
is
mixed
into
their
drugs
and
the
extra
potency
is
proving
deadly
.
``
It
is
just
going
to
take
the
community
as
a
whole
to
come
together
and
fight
this
,
''
Buncich
said
.
Not
a
day
goes
by
without
an
addict
being
incarcerated
at
the
Lake
County
Jail
,
he
said
.
Buncich
said
42
people
were
being
treated
at
the
jail
for
serious
addictions
Monday
.
He
said
the
expense
of
treatment
,
and
of
supplying
the
sheriff
's
department
officers
with
naloxone
,
the
heroin
overdose
antidote
,
continues
to
grow
.
``
We
are
facing
a
serious
,
serious
situation
here
in
Lake
County
.
It
is
really
hitting
home
here
,
''
Buncich
said
.
The
sheriff
said
police
are
doing
what
they
can
on
the
enforcement
end
regarding
the
problem
but
the
solution
is
not
behind
a
badge
alone
.
``
We
have
to
get
a
message
out
.
We
need
to
start
young
.
We
need
to
start
within
the
schools
right
away
,
''
Buncich
said
,
adding
the
conversation
in
schools
used
to
be
about
marijuana
.
Now
,
he
said
,
it
needs
to
be
about
the
dangers
of
heroin
.
``
It
's
a
wake-up
call
,
''
Buncich
said
.
Frey
said
part
of
the
spike
in
deaths
being
seen
now
has
been
attributed
to
an
increased
use
of
heroin
laced
with
the
narcotic
painkiller
fentanyl
,
the
most
powerful
painkiller
for
medical
use
.
As
early
as
March
2015
,
the
U.S.
Drug
Enforcement
Administration
issued
a
nationwide
alert
warning
of
the
dangers
of
fentanyl
and
fentanyl
analogues
.
According
to
the
DEA
on
its
website
,
fentanyl
is
30
to
50
times
more
powerful
than
heroin
and
100
times
more
powerful
than
morphine
.
Many
of
the
overdose
victims
have
a
cocktail
of
other
drugs
and
alcohol
in
their
system
including
heroin
,
cocaine
,
fentanyl
,
marijuana
,
benzodiazepine
and
alcohol
,
Frey
said
.
In
2016
,
93
of
the
114
overdose
deaths
were
attributed
to
controlled
substance
.
A
controlled
substance
can
be
any
type
of
narcotic
including
prescription
drugs
not
used
as
they
are
prescribed
.
Heroin
was
found
in
the
blood
streams
of
55
of
the
114
overdose
victims
in
2016
.
Fentanyl
was
discovered
in
27
of
the
victims
and
benzodiazepine
was
discovered
in
75
of
the
victims
.
``
It
sends
a
startling
message
of
how
dangerous
heroin
is
and
how
dangerous
it
is
mixed
with
other
substances
.
The
combinations
are
proving
to
be
deadly
,
''
Frey
said
.
Addicts
,
such
as
the
woman
who
died
Friday
,
may
be
falling
victim
to
the
laced
heroin
because
of
its
unexpected
potency
,
Frey
said
.
The
dose
that
killed
the
woman
was
so
strong
she
died
while
still
in
the
process
of
injecting
herself
,
Frey
said
.
She
said
the
situation
is
tragic
.
``
Guess
who
is
finding
those
victims
?
It
's
the
ones
who
love
them
the
most
-
their
moms
and
dads
,
''
Frey
said
.

is
ground
zero
for

violence

The

had
more

than
any

city
between

June
2014

the
New

sent
a
team

there
to
try

figure
out
what
was
behind
the
horrendous
killings
.
As
the
first
housing
cooperative
operated

owned
by
African-Americans
,
Parkway
Gardens
was
a

was
seen
as
an
alternative
to
the

the

is
every

CHICAGO
--
An
outpouring
of
grief
tonight
for
the
two
girls
who
lost
their
young
lives
in
shootings
.
12-year-old
Kanari
Gentry-Bowers
and
11-year-old
Takiya
Holmes
were
both
shot
the
same
night
in
two
separate

was
shot
while

school
in

while
sitting
in

A
man
is
facing
multiple
felony
and
misdemeanor
charges
after
a
crash
Wednesday
afternoon
in
southwest
suburban
Plano
.
A
vehicle
crashed
into
a
utility
pole
about
4:10
p.m.
at
River
and
Blackhawk
roads
in
unincorporated
Plano
,

A
contentious
lawsuit
filed
by
a
man
convicted
of
a
1992
double
murder
he
says
he
didn
’
t
commit
is
set
for
trial
Monday
in
federal
court
.
Deon
Patrick
has
sued
the
city
,
seven
Chicago
police
officers
and
two
Cook
County
prosecutors
over
his
conviction
for
the
slayings
of
Jeffrey
Lassiter
and
Sharon
Haugabook
.
He
spent
two
decades
in
prison
before
Cook
County
prosecutors
dismissed
the
murder
charges
against
him
in
2014
.
Patrick
claims
authorities
also
railroaded
six
of
his
seven
co-defendants
in
the
criminal
case
.
They
ranged
in
age
from
15
to
22
at
the
time
.
Patrick
was
20
.
The
lawsuit
is
set
for
trial
in
front
of
U.S.
District
Judge
Ronald
A.
Guzman
,
who
wrote
in
October
that
“
the
truly
undisputed
facts
”
of
the
case
“
are
relatively
few.
”
While
the
officers
and
prosecutors
insist
the
case
“
is
nothing
but
straightforward
police
work
that
led
to
the
arrest
and
conviction
of
eight
murderers
,
”
Patrick
sees
a
series
of
“
carefully
fabricated
lies
,
”
according
to
the
judge
.
“
There
are
really
two
stories
to
tell
,
”
Guzman
wrote
.
The
defendants
in
the
federal
lawsuit
include
Joseph
Magats
,
the
chief
of
the
criminal
prosecutions
bureau
at
the
Cook
County
State
’
s
Attorney
’
s
Office
.
Representatives
of
the
city
and
the
state
’
s
attorney
’
s
office
declined
to
comment
ahead
of
the
trial
.
Patrick
’
s
attorney
,
Stuart
Chanen
of
the
Valorem
Law
Group
,
simply
said
,
“
we
’
re
looking
forward
to
trying
the
case.
”
Patrick
’
s
legal
team
filed
an
emergency
motion
for
sanctions
Sunday
afternoon
,
claiming
the
state
’
s
attorney
’
s
office
withheld
key
documents
until
the
eve
of
trial
.
When
he
announced
his
lawsuit
in
May
2014
,
Patrick
acknowledged
he
was
“
no
angel
”
at
the
time
of
his
arrest
.
He
said
he
was
a
member
of
the
Vice
Lords
gang
and
had
been
arrested
about
20
times
.
But
he
has
long
argued
he
was
innocent
of
the
murders
.

Police
said
Johnson
and
a
man
were
walking
near
600
Lake
Shore
Drive
in
the
city
’
s
Gold
Coast

Two
men
who
originally
got
life
sentences
without
parole
for
a
double
murder
in
Chicago
when
they
were
teenagers
were
resentenced
Monday
to
shorter
prison
terms
.
Darnell
Foxx
and
his
cousin
Javell
Ivory
were
15
and
17
,
respectively
,
when
they
participated
in
a
drive-by
shooting
that
killed
a
man
and
a
pregnant
woman
in
1997
.
On
Monday
,
a
Cook
County
judge
reduced
Ivory
's
sentence
to
54
years
and
Foxx
's
to
73
years
.
With
the
nearly
20
years
that
each
man
has
already
served
in
prison
,
plus
time
off
for
good
behavior
,
Foxx
could
regain
his
freedom
in
less
than
18
years
,
while
Ivory
could
be
released
in
as
little
as
eight
years
.
Authorities
said
the
men
,
now
in
their
30s
,
were
among
five
people
in
a
van
that
pulled
up
alongside
a
group
of
people
near
a
gas
station
