A 19-year-old Chicago man, on parole for robbery, has been charged with the
fatal shooting of a taxi driver in Evanston on May 15.

Darien Lawrence Marquez Connerly, of 2005 W. Jarvis Ave., was charged with
first-degree murder and attempted armed robbery for shooting driver Leodis
Blackburn, Evanston Police Cmdr. Tom Guenther said at a press conference
Monday.

Investigators said Blackburn picked up Connerly on Howard Street, and Connerly
told Blackburn to stop the cab in the 500 block of Elmwood Avenue. He started
to get out of the cab before pulling out a .25-caliber semiautomatic handgun
and demanding money, Guenther said.

When Blackburn tried to drive away, Connerly shot him once in the head before
fleeing, Guenther said.

Detectives following up on an anonymous tip learned Connerly is on parole for
aggravated robbery, Guenther said. Investigators then worked with state
corrections personnel to arrest Connerly Saturday in Chicago.

Guenther said surveillance video from cameras in the Howard Street area showed
Connerly getting into Blackburn’s cab on Howard.

Blackburn worked for Evanston Best Taxi for about 10 years, and had returned
to driving a cab only a week before he was shot after working a stint as a
dispatcher, said Sharon McKinley, whose family owns the company.

He was pronounced dead of his injuries three days after the shooting at St.
Francis Hospital.

Employees at the closely knit cab company “are taking it hard, especially when
you’re a nice guy,” McKinley said.

Blackburn, who she described as mild mannered, had a wife and a 6-year-old
son, Marcus, living in Georgia, to whom he would send some of his earnings.

“It’s been terrible all week,” she said. “Everybody knew him, everybody liked
him.”

She said the company was to hold a memorial service for him at 10 a.m. Tuesday
at 3125 Roosevelt Road in Chicago.

Connerly, who was denied bail Monday, is scheduled to appear June 21 in Cook
County Court in Skokie.

CHICAGO--

A federal judge has ruled a company that tried to avoid paying overtime to 57
Chicago-area security guards by making them sign independent contractor
agreements must pay them more than $203,000.

  
U.S. Department of Labor officials said in a release Tuesday that Judge
Virginia M. Kendall's ruling against International Detective & Protective
Services included more than $101,577 in back wages and an equal amount in
liquidated damages.

The judgment also imposed a permanent injunction that forbids the company from
violating in the future the overtime and record-keeping provisions of the Fair
Labor Standards Act.

  
Authorities say the company misclassified employees in an attempt to avoid
paying time-and-a-half overtime.

  
A telephone listing for a Chicago office of International Detective &
Protective Services was disconnected Tuesday.

11:05 a.m. CDT  ,  June 16, 2011

SPRINGFIELD, Ill.--

Encouraging inmates to get jobs in prison and then taking away the money they
make to pay for their incarceration is absurd and unjust, the [ Illinois
Supreme Court ][1] ruled Thursday.

  
Although the state may take a percentage of prisoners' earnings and ""assets""
such as Social Security or pension benefits, state law does not allow
confiscating all money earned at jobs worked behind bars.

The state Department of Corrections had sued convicted murderer Kensley
Hawkins for the estimated $455,000 cost of keeping him locked up in a Joliet
prison from 1983 to 2005. Officials sought authority to take a good chunk of
the $11,000 he had in a savings account after working as a furniture
assembler.

  
Justice Rita Garman, writing for a unanimous court, decided that two state
laws that seem to contradict each other allow Corrections to seek
reimbursement for the cost of incarceration and may take a portion of prison
wages to satisfy that cost -- in Hawkins' case, 3 percent, or $750.

  
But the law says the rest shall be deposited into inmates' bank accounts.

  
Any other interpretation is ""absurd, unjust,"" and not what lawmakers intended,
Garman wrote.

  
A prison system that takes away what inmates earn also takes away incentive to
work and learn a marketable skill, Justice Lloyd Karmeier wrote in a special
concurring opinion.

  
""Work may be its own reward for some, but probably not for most inmates in the
Department of Corrections,"" Karmeier wrote. ""Once inmates realized that the
extra work necessary to generate savings would benefit only the Department of
Corrections, not them, they would quickly reevaluate the utility of prison
employment.""

  
A Corrections Department spokeswoman did not immediately respond to requests
for comment.

  
Robyn Ziegler, of [ Attorney General Lisa Madigan ][13] 's staff, said the
opinion ""provides some much-needed clarity to the law and recognizes that the
state can continue to recoup costs of incarceration under other
circumstances.""

  
Hawkins' lawyer, David Simonton, said the ruling proves "" [ Illinois ][10] is
serious in promoting the basic hope of its prison system -- namely, that once
inmates are released they will not return to a life of crime.""

  
""Working and saving pays off,"" Simonton said. ""This is a necessary step to
prevent inmates from immediately falling into poverty and homelessness and
back into the cycle of crime.""

  
Hawkins, convicted of murder, armed robbery and other crimes in Will County in
1982, is not scheduled for release until May 2028.

  
But studies show that inmates who work in vocational programs are 20 percent
less likely to re-offend, according to the Institute for People with Criminal
Records, a [ Colorado ][14] -based non-profit group, which filed a brief in
the case.

  
It also pointed to a study that found that of more than 20,000 inmates
released to Chicago communities in 2005, 1,200 of them wound up homeless.

  
------   
  
The case is People v. Hawkins.

The 42nd annual Chicago Pride Parade marched forward Sunday, even though the
tires on 30 to 50 floats were slashed hours before the event’s start.

The floats were damaged overnight at a storage facility, Associated
Attractions Enterprises Inc., near 48th and Halsted streets, and an employee
discovered the damage about 5 a.m., police News Affairs Officer John Mirabelli
said.

A parade official said the tires were being repaired in time for the noon
start of the parade at Belmont and Halsted. All of the floats were expected to
be repaired in time to be in the parade, though several will not proceed in
the planned order.

In addition to the tires being slashed, the float of Chicago’s Gay and Lesbian
Hall of Fame was damaged but fixed before the parade’s start.

“The first parade had no floats,” State Rep. Kelly Cassidy (14th District)
said. “...We don’t need floats to have a great parade. The Grinch can’t steal
the pride parade.”

Asked if she thought the tire slashing was a hate crime, she said: “It’s hard
not to think so a couple of days after New York’s huge victory” allowing gay
couples to marry.

Police did not have the number of floats affected and said no one was in
custody Sunday morning.

Ariel [ Gomez ][2] sat among a handful of fellow inmates at a round table
inside an education room at the Pontiac Correctional Center and opened up
about the troubling path that led him to a life behind bars.

  
Tom Beatty, a chaplain and director of the New Life Corrections Ministry,
paced around the room, listening to Gomez, 31, and 25 other men talk about
their lives, how to manage their anger, their drug and [ alcohol abuse ][3]
and, most importantly, their roles as fathers.

During a two-day program this week, called ""Transforming Incarcerated Dads,""
Beatty lectured about their approaches to problem-solving and led the
volunteers in group discussions about what it means to be a Christian dad.

  
A former drug addict who had trouble with the law, Beatty could empathize with
the men he's now trying to help. He found himself unable to change, he said,
until he read the Bible.

  
""I put my trust in Jesus, and he changed my life,"" Beatty said. ""We can learn
to be the kind of men that God created us to be so (their kids) can catch it
from them.""

  
The program is part of the Illinois Department of Corrections' Fatherhood
Initiative, which operates on the theory that by teaching inmates to be better
fathers, it can help them keep their children from making the same mistakes
they did and reduce the inmates' recidivism, said Sharyn Elman, chief public
information officer for IDOC. All of the men participating in this week's
training volunteered.

  
""They're hungry to be better,"" said Emily Ruskin, orientation and reentry
services coordinator for IDOC.

  
The way men parent -- even from prison -- makes a big difference in whether a
child will follow in their footsteps. A child is seven times more likely to be
incarcerated if a parent has been in prison, said Debbie Denning, IDOC acting
chief of programs and support services.

  
""In the end, it's the child (who is) a victim of incarceration,"" Denning said.

  
Many fathers in prison don't know what to say to their children, she said.
Through these programs, men learn to communicate by making children feel
special, following through on promised calls and letters and setting a
standing date to talk so children can look forward to that time, Ruskin said.

  
Gomez, who is scheduled to be paroled in 2018, said the men are working to
respond positively to difficult situations, rather than yelling or resorting
to violence.

  
""I think it gets me ready for situations that I react wrongly to,"" he said.

  
Many of the men don't have solid relationships with their own fathers, Beatty
said. Gomez's father went to prison for drug crimes, he said.

  
""If I had somebody that would have shown me how to be a man,"" better choices
may have been made, Gomez said. ""My dad never told me he loved me.""

  
The Fatherhood Initiative teaches men to open up, make better decisions,
develop confidence and deal with victimization they've faced or inflicted on
others, Ruskin said.

  
Gomez was sentenced to 35 years in prison for a 1997 murder. He and his wife
have two children, he said. The family visits Gomez once a week and speaks
with him by phone every Sunday. Gomez also participates in a weekly parenting
class.

  
Once out, Gomez will ""be there for them, communicate with them and love them,""
he said.

  
The family is working to give the kids a better life, said Gomez, who received
his GED in prison. While two days doesn't seem like a lot of time, Beatty
wants to give the inmates incentive to become better fathers.

  
""I pray that the men get excited about the fact that they can have a positive
influence on their kids,"" Beatty said.

CHICAGO--

Security cameras linked directly to police stations may be coming to more than
a dozen troubled Chicago high schools in a bid to create a safer atmosphere in
the nation's third-largest school district.

  
[ Chicago Public Schools ][1] CEO [ Jean-Claude Brizard ][2] has proposed the
approximately $7 million strategy, following a pilot program at [ Fenger High
School ][3] . In 2009, a Fenger honors student was beaten to death by a group
of teens in attack that was caught on camera. The widely-circulated video
prompted outrage nationwide and several safety measures have been instituted
at the high school since then.

[ Derrion Albert ][11]

Brizard said the cameras are important even as the district with more than
400,000 students faces a $612 million deficit.

  
""Despite the tough economic times facing our district, we're taking additional
steps to reduce crime and create a school environments that are safe for
students and staff, which is vital for teaching and learning,"" Brizard said in
a statement Sunday. ""Enhancing and maintaining a real sense of safety and
creating a positive environment within our schools is a significant tool in
driving student outcomes.""

  
Schools officials said misconduct, arrests and crimes have dropped
dramatically at the high school on the city's South Side since installation of
the high-tech camera system. The system also is installed at two other high
schools.

  
Under the plan, cameras would be expanded to high schools with higher numbers
of arrests and misconduct cases. Schools selected to receive cameras are:
Clemente, Hyde Park, Sullivan, Morgan Park, Orr, Marshall, Dunbar, Tilden,
Bogan, Wells, Senn, Juarez, Julian and Farragut.

  
Other safety measures were instituted at Fenger after the death of [ Derrion
Albert ][11] , one of its students. In a cellphone video that circulated
worldwide after it was posted online, Albert's attackers are seen punching and
kicking him, slamming him over the head with large boards and finally,
stomping on his head. The attack occurred on a street a few blocks from
Fenger.

  
Last week, a 20-year-old man was sentenced to 32 years in prison for his role
in the beating, making him the fourth of five defendants in the case to
receive lengthy prison terms.

A man charged with robbing a cabdriver in Chicago was back in court today
after authorities identified him as a man who got into a waiting taxi after
robbing a Prospect Heights bank employee last week.

Bond for Antonio Crawford was set at $200,000 in Rolling Meadows branch court
on a second charge of armed robbery.

Authorities said Crawford was previously charged with the armed robbery of the
taxi driver who drove him from the northwest suburbs to the 1200 block of
south Ashland Avenue in Chicago after the alleged bank teller robbery.

The city is obligated to pay for former [ Mayor Richard Daley ][25] legal
defense against lawsuits that allege his involvement in conspiracies to cover
up police brutality under former Chicago police Cmdr. [ Jon Burge ][22] ,
Mayor [ Rahm Emanuel ][26] said Wednesday.

  
The city would keep a tight rein on the costs of defending Daley, Emanuel
said. ""We're not going to be reckless and let the meter run legally,"" he said.

  
In January, Burge was sentenced to 4 1/2 years in prison for lying about the
torture and abuse of criminal suspects. Emanuel said Burge should lose his
pension.

  
A ruling issued last month by U.S. District Judge Rebecca Pallmeyer applies to
only one of several lawsuits filed in the Burge brutality cases. It allows
Daley to remain as a defendant in the lawsuit filed on behalf of plaintiff
Michael Tillman.

  
According to Flint Taylor, an attorney for Tillman, the ruling allows Daley to
be deposed.

  
Taylor wants to depose Daley in September, but the city has filed a motion
asking Pallmeyer to reconsider her ruling.

  
Judges have rejected efforts to name Daley as a defendant in three other
brutality lawsuits stemming from the torture and abuse perpetrated years ago
on dozens of African-American men, some of whom gave coerced confessions.

  
In the Tillman complaint, Daley is named both as mayor and as Cook County
state's attorney, a post he held from 1981 to 1989.

  
Because the lawsuit covers Daley's time as mayor, the city is legally bound to
pay for his defense, said a spokeswoman for the city's Law Department.

  
In her ruling, Pallmeyer dismissed six counts against Daley but upheld counts
that alleged he was part of the broader torture conspiracy. In a motion asking
Pallmeyer to reconsider her decision, Daley's attorneys argued that he retains
prosecutorial immunity from his time as state's attorney.

  
The Tillman case marks the first time a judge has ruled there is reason to
allow Daley to remain in the lawsuit, Taylor said.

  
Tillman served nearly 24 years in prison for a July 1986 rape and murder
before his conviction was vacated and the charges dismissed by a Cook County
special prosecutor in January 2010, according to the ruling. He received a
certificate of innocence from Cook County Circuit Court in February 2010.

  
Emanuel said it would be inappropriate for him to comment specifically on the
Tillman case.

  
Emanuel's position that Burge's pension should be revoked is backed by [
Attorney General Lisa Madigan ][20] , whose office has sued to block Burge
from pocketing further pension payments.

  
Earlier this year the city's Police Pension Board allowed Burge to continue to
collect his $3,039 a month pension in spite of his criminal conviction.

  
""I believe, and I advocated for this in Congress, that when you're convicted
of a crime ... that deals with your professional life, you've lost the
benefits associated with that because you've dishonored the office,"" Emanuel
said.

  
The mayor made his comments at an unrelated news conference where he announced
that the city will allow architects to submit plans electronically to speed up
the approval and permitting process.

  
The legal community representing the torture victims said it has been waiting
to hear Emanuel's response to the decades-old scandal. Taylor said he has not
seen a change in the way the city is defending the Burge cases.

  
""He is now a convicted felon for lying about torture,"" Taylor said of Burge.
""Yet (the city is) sending six lawyers to every court hearing. … Morally,
politically and legally (Emanuel) should be looking at it with fresh eyes. It
is well past time to stop defending the torturers and their co-conspirators
and, rather compensate the victims.""

SPRINGFIELD, Ill. (AP) -- A state panel created to study racial profiling in
traffic stops in [ Illinois ][2] has fallen a bit behind in its work. Five
years after state officials approved it, the group hasn't held a single
meeting.

  
That's largely because the governor -- first Gov. [ Rod Blagojevich ][3] and
now Gov. [ Pat Quinn ][4] -- failed to appoint anyone to serve on the panel,
known formally as the Racial Profiling Prevention and Data Oversight Board.
Legislative leaders long ago announced their four appointments to the board,
but even that didn't get the governors to take action on the remaining eight
spots.

The delay has even become an issue in a discrimination allegation against the
state police.

  
The Illinois branch of the [ American Civil Liberties Union ][14] has asked
for a federal probe into why statistics show the state police are more likely
to press minority drivers for permission to search their vehicles. The ACLU's
request argues that the failure to appoint an oversight board shows the state
isn't serious about making sure minority drivers don't face discrimination.

  
Quinn says he considers racial profiling a serious issue that deserves
attention. But the Democratic governor offers only vague answers when asked
about the delays and when he might take action.

  
""There's a lot of things you have to do (as governor) and we focus on
everything we can do fast,"" Quinn said Wednesday. ""We'll look at that one,
too.""

  
But some critics say that's not good enough for a governor who has been in
office 2 1/2  years.

  
""This long delay is ridiculous,"" said Donald Jackson, president of the
Illinois state conference of the [ NAACP ][17] . ""I think he's dragging his
feet. He's not taking it as seriously as he should.""

  
Illinois collects data every year on virtually every traffic stop in the
state. Experts hired by the state then study the information to see whether
there is any suggestion that police treat minorities differently than they
treat white drivers.

  
Year after year, the figures show persistent differences.

  
In the most recent report, minority drivers accounted for 12 percent more
traffic stops than would be expected based just on their share of Illinois'
population. The study also found that 55 percent of white drivers got tickets
after being pulled over, compared to 65 percent of Hispanic drivers and 62
percent of black drivers.

  
And the numbers show that police are far more likely to ask minorities to
allow a vehicle search than to ask white drivers, even though there's actually
a better chance of finding illegal contraband among white drivers.

  
The oversight board is supposed to look at how information on traffic stops is
collected, whether the process can be improved and whether Illinois needs new
laws or policies to prevent racial profiling.

  
Sen. Tim Bivins, R-Dixon, is one of the lawmakers appointed to serve on the
oversight board. The former county sheriff questions whether the racial data
is accurate and would like to consider including race on drivers licenses so
police don't have to guess when filing their reports. But those questions
aren't being addressed while the oversight board is inactive.

  
""Either do something with it or let it sunset,"" Bivins said.

  
Blagojevich and lawmakers approved creation of the oversight board in 2006. It
was supposed to begin work in January 2008. The governor appoints eight
members to the board. Legislative leaders appoint four, and the state attorney
general, transportation secretary and state police director all send
representatives.

  
Nothing ever happened, however.

  
Senate President [ John Cullerton ][18] blames the governor's office.

  
""Both Governor Quinn and his predecessor neglected to make their appointments
to the Board, preventing it from having a quorum and thereby being able to
function,"" said Cullerton spokeswoman Rikeesha Phelon.

  
Blagojevich, who was impeached in 2009, was notorious for ignoring the
administrative chores of being governor, including naming people to panels
like this oversight board. Aides say Quinn is chipping away at the enormous
backlog of vacant and expired terms he inherited from Blagojevich.

  
In the two months since the ACLU asked the Justice Department to investigate
the state police, Quinn has made several appointments to boards with important
regulatory duties. He has also found time for appointments to panels like the
Elgin-O'Hare West Bypass Advisory Council and the Nursing Advisory Board.

  
Ed Yohnka, spokesman for the Illinois ACLU, calls the oversight board a missed
opportunity to make sure state laws and police policies are fair to all
drivers.

  
""The fact that there hasn't been this board functioning in an independent
fashion has really created an obstacle towards solutions,"" he said.

In 1983, when Stanley Wrice said police had beaten him into confessing to a
brutal rape he didn't commit, the judge wasn't buying it.

  
Chicago police officers denied they had hit him on the head and limbs and in
the groin with a flashlight and a rubber hose, and the judge allowed the
confession to be used at trial. Wrice was convicted and sent to prison. He's
still there.

  
To this day, Wrice insists he was coerced into confessing. That claim can't be
dismissed anymore, given the ugly truths that have come to light during his
incarceration. Last year, former Chicago police Cmdr. [ Jon Burge ][18] was
convicted of lying under oath about the systematic torture of African-American
men that took place for decades at the Area 2 police headquarters.

  
Burge is serving 4 1/2 years. Wrice's projected release date is September
2044.

  
Yet a special prosecutor continues to fight Wrice's petition for a new
hearing. An appellate court ruled last year that a 2006 special prosecutor's
report provided ""significant corroboration"" of Wrice's torture claim and that
a post-conviction hearing is warranted. The state appealed that ruling to the
[ Illinois Supreme Court ][19] , saying the confession, if coerced, is
""harmless error"" because the rest of the evidence still supports a conviction.

  
At least 14 other men remain in prison despite long-standing claims that they
were tortured into confessing. Their cases -- most dating back to the 1970s
and '80s -- are making their way, slowly and separately, through the appeals
process. Other inmates have won their fight for a new hearing but remain
behind bars awaiting their day in court. Every day compounds this travesty. It
must be set right.

  
Last week, a group of lawyers, politicians and community activists filed a
friend-of-the-court brief asking the Supreme Court to take steps to resolve
those cases quickly. They want the court to order Cook County's chief judge to
hold hearings to determine whether the convictions were compromised by torture
and to void any that rest on confessions obtained through abuse.

  
They also want the court to affirm its long-standing position that using a
coerced confession to help convict someone is never ""harmless error.""

  
Those signing the brief include former Gov. [ Jim Thompson ][21] and former
U.S. Sen. [ Adlai Stevenson ][23] , several former state and federal judges
and prosecutors, and dozens of lawyers, legislators and legal scholars.

  
The group doesn't take a position on the guilt or innocence of any of the
prisoners, nor does it urge that their convictions automatically be voided. It
simply argues that they are entitled to hearings to determine whether their
cases should stand.

  
""We have a common and firm belief that the body politic is poisoned when
claims of systematic police abuse and torture are dismissed as 'harmless,'""
the brief says. ""Our combined experiences lead us to believe these allegations
must be investigated, heard and, when warranted, redressed, and the sooner the
better.""

  
A number of cases have made it through the system, and the results reinforce
calls to expedite the others. In 2003, four men who had been sent to death row
based on false confessions obtained by Burge and his crew were pardoned by
then-Gov. [ George Ryan ][17] . In the years since the 2006 special
prosecutor's report, five Burge victims serving life sentences have been
released.

  
In other cases, courts have ordered evidentiary hearings, similar to those
proposed in the amicus brief, or reversed convictions and sent them back for
retrial.

  
A sobering consequence of this process is that it could lead to the release of
prisoners who are in fact guilty. Subtract the confession, and the cases
against them could crumble. Evidence is old, memories are faded, witnesses
have died. It's a risk we are forced to accept. Our justice system requires
that we err on the side of releasing the guilty rather than incarcerating the
innocent. And the prisoners in question, guilty or not, have spent many years
behind bars.

  
Another downside is that freed inmates will no doubt join the long line of
civil plaintiffs seeking damages from the city. Taxpayers already have shelled
out more than $43 million in legal fees and settlements stemming from Burge's
actions. Last week, a federal judge ruled that former [ Mayor Richard Daley
][25] can be held liable in suits brought by Burge's victims. Mayor [ Rahm
Emanuel ][20] says the city is obligated to pay Daley's legal fees too. Oh,
and when Burge gets out of prison, he's still entitled to a pension, according
to the police pension board.

  
Taxpayers are stuck with all of this not only because Burge and his crew
obtained confessions from suspects by beating them, shocking their genitals
and putting plastic bags over their heads, but because city and law
enforcement officials turned a blind eye to the abuse.

  
How many innocent men languish in prison even after their torturer has been
called to account? We don't know. It's time we found out.

When the mob came for him Friday night, Devonta Moore knew he didn’t stand a
chance.

As many as 20 youths were shouting that they wanted his cellphone, so he
dropped it and ran. The Perspectives Academy student had nearly made it to the
Cermak Chinatown CTA station when he was tripped from behind, then “curled
into a fetal position and waited for it to be over.”

The sickening beating he received around 10:30 p.m. was captured on a CTA
security video, which shows at least two youths making a “running leap” and
landing on the victim’s head, a police source said.

“They stomped him,” the source said. “They pounded the s--- out of him.”

As Moore, 18, recovered Sunday from a fractured skull and 15 stitches on and
around his left eyelid, five of seven youths charged in connection with the
attack appeared before a Cook County judge. The attackers, age 17, from
Edgewater and Skokie were charged with robbery, mob action, and aggravated
battery with great bodily harm.

Prosecutors said CTA security guards witnessed the attack and helped police to

the 8100 block of Knox in Skokie; Devin Mossiah, of the 6600 block of North
Ashland; Denzel Olagbegi, of the 1400 block of West Pratt; and Duwon Polk, of
the 1700 block of West Pratt. Olagbegi, also charged in an unrelated April
robbery, was held on bail of $200,000; Adedokum and Demaret, $150,000 and Polk
and Mossiah, $100,000. Two 16-year-olds also arrested at the station were
charged as juveniles with robbery and mob action, police said.

Moore hadescorted a female friend onto a bus before the attack. He could not
see out of his left eye Sunday but attended church. Parishioners at Christ
Bibles Church in South Shore prayed for him, he said. “And I’m just thanking
God I’m going to be okay,” he added.

9:43 a.m. CDT  ,  September 28, 2011

A parolee out of prison since March is accused of carjacking an SUV, then
crashing into a school bus as he fled from Chicago police, officials said.

Hector Maisonet, 52, stole a black Chevrolet Trailblazer from a woman in the
2300 block of North Milwaukee Avenue in the Palmer Square neighborhood on the
Northwest Side at about 10:30 a.m. Tuesday, according to Police News Affairs
Officer Robert Perez.

Shakespeare District police spotted the SUV about two hours later near
Diversey and Sacramento avenues, Perez said.

When Maisonet, also known as ""Fingers,"" saw the officers, he tried to reverse
the SUV to escape but struck a school bus carrying four children, then hit a
building, Perez said.

Maisonet ran, and when officers caught up to him, he resisted, police said.
The officers used a stun gun to subdue him and arrested him, Perez said.

As a precaution, Maisonet was taken to Advocate Illinois Masonic Medical
Center for observation. None of the children was injured during the incident,
Perez said.

Maisonet, of the 3000 block of West Wellington Avenue, was charged Tuesday
with aggravated carjacking, aggravated battery to a police officer, driving
with a suspended license, negligent driving and leaving the scene of an
accident, Perez said. He also had an outstanding warrant for a parole
violation.

According to court records, Maisonet was released from Menard Correctional
Center in March after serving about 17 years of a 30-year sentence for an
attempted armed robbery. He has an extensive criminal record dating to 1978
with convictions for attempted murder, escaping from a penal institution,
burglary and theft, according to court records.

Maisonet was scheduled to appear this afternoon in bond court, Perez said.

Federal agents on Thursday raided a [ Boeing ][1] plant that makes military
helicopters in a [ Philadelphia ][2] suburb and charged more than three dozen
people with distributing or trying to get [ prescription drugs ][3] , among
them powerful painkillers.

  
The arrests were made by the [ FBI ][4] and the Drug Enforcement
Administration at the 5,400-employee plant in Ridley Park, where workers build
aircraft including the H-47 Chinook helicopter and the V-22 Osprey. The plant,
part of Boeing's Defense, Space and Security unit, is also the headquarters
for its Rotorcraft division.

It did not appear to be an organized drug ring, but rather a ""nebulous"" series
of independent actors, authorities said.

  
""These sales placed the individual abusers, as well as society at large, at
risk,"" said DEA agent Vito S. Guarino.

  
All but one of the 37 people charged were current or former Boeing employees,
U.S. Attorney Zane Memeger said at a news conference. He did not know what
kind of jobs they had and said he wasn't aware of any accidents or problems
involving aircraft made by the suspects.

  
Indictments were unsealed charging 23 people with illegal distribution of a
prescription drug, federal prosecutors said. In addition, 14 others were
charged with attempted possession of the various drugs &#8212; including the
painkillers fentanyl, oxycodone and others &#8212; allegedly being sold by
their co-workers. Prosecutors said all but one of those charged had been
arrested, but they declined to comment on the status of the 37th.

  
Boeing informed authorities of their suspicions about drug activity on the
property after an internal investigation, company spokesman Damien Mills said
in a statement.

  
""Boeing commends the U.S. Attorney's Office, and other federal law enforcement
agencies for their rigorous and thorough investigation, throughout which we
took appropriate steps to ensure safety of our employees and the absolute
integrity and quality of the products we produce for our customers,"" the
statement read.

  
Employees are tested if they're suspected of being under the influence of
drugs or alcohol, the statement said.

  
A man who answered the telephone at the union for workers at the plant
declined to comment. A message left for a spokeswoman for the Department of
Defense was not immediately returned.

  
Prosecutors said they don't think there was any connection between the drug
arrests and a 2008 error at the plant.

  
In November that year, Boeing temporarily shut down two production lines that
make the Chinook and Osprey after a plastic cap was found in the fuel line of
an in-production Osprey. Boeing later submitted a corrective action plan and
restarted production.

  
In May that year, the factory was shut down when a disgruntled employee used
his work-issued wire cutters to sever about 70 electrical wires in a nearly
finished Chinook. That employee, Matthew Montgomery, of Trevose, pleaded
guilty to destroying property under contract to the government. Authorities
said he was upset about a job transfer.

WASHINGTON--

The Supreme Count on Tuesday seemed deeply divided on how far the government
can intrude inside the employment practices of churches and religious groups,
a decision being closely watched by religious institutions concerned about
their independence and by civil rights groups looking out for their employees.

  
The issue in the dispute between the Hosanna-Tabor Evangelical Lutheran Church
and School of Redford, Mich., and former teacher Cheryl Perich is whether a
government agency has the right to sue the school on her behalf for firing her
after she complained of discrimination under the Americans with Disabilities
Act.

[ Samuel A. Alito ][16]

[ Ruth Bader Ginsburg ][17]

Perich was promoted from a temporary lay teacher to a ""called"" teacher in 2000
at the Redford, Mich., school by a vote of the church's congregation and hired
as a commissioned minister. She taught secular classes, as well as a religious
class four days a week. She also occasionally led chapel service.

  
She got sick in 2004 but tried to return to work from disability leave despite
being diagnosed with narcolepsy. The school said she couldn't return because
they had hired a substitute for that year. They fired her after she showed up
and threatened to sue to get her job back.

  
Perich complained to the [ Equal Employment Opportunity Commission ][13] ,
which sued the church for violations under the disabilities act.

  
A federal judge threw out the lawsuit, saying that Perich fell under the ADA's
ministerial exception, which keeps the government from interfering with church
affairs. But the 6th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals reinstated her lawsuit,
saying Perich's ""primary function was teaching secular subjects"" so the
exception didn't apply.

  
""There was no difference in what she was doing"" at the school before she was
commissioned and after, [ Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg ][17] said during the
oral arguments. And when a church employee is performing a function that deals
with the public such as education, argued lawyer Walter Dellinger, they ""ought
to be governed by the same rules"" as other employers.

  
The church's lawyer, Douglas Laycock, argued that since Perich was a minister
as well as a teacher, and those jobs overlapped, the government could not get
involved in the church's hiring and firing decisions.

  
""If you teach the doctrines of the faith, you are a minister,"" Laycock said.

  
Courts normally give a lot of deference to a church's decision of who is a
minister and who is not, Justice [ Samuel Alito ][16] said. If they don't, he
said, the government then would have to get into the business of deciding who
is an official minister of a church and who is not.

  
""You cannot get away from evaluating religious issues,"" something courts are
not supposed to do, Alito said.

  
The court will issue a ruling in the spring.

  
The case is Hosanna-Tabor Evangelical Lutheran Church & School v. Equal
Employment Opportunity Commission, 10-553.

he was cleared by DNA evidence in 2005.

  
His co-defendant, Dan Young Jr., also served time. A year after his release,
Young died in a hit-and-run crash.

  
Police have said the investigation into the murder is ongoing.

  
The officers accused of beating Hill had worked for former Lt. [ Jon Burge

A Wisconsin man was sentenced to three years in prison Wednesday after he
pleaded guilty to sexually abusing a 14-year-old girl he met online.

Alan Robinson, 48, was arrested in early December when officers found him and
the “terrified” minor inside a blue Dodge van in the 1300 block of West
Lexington, according to police.

Police saw the van, which had tinted windows, parked with its lights on and
engine running at 9 a.m. that day. When they approached the van, Robinson told
police he had been sleeping. Officers than saw a girl under a blanket inside
the van. When asked, the girl claimed Robinson was her uncle.

Police later learned Robinson was not a relative but someone the teenager had
been communicating with online and by cell phone, authorities said.

OMAHA, Neb.--

U.S. officials illegally allowed a Canadian company to begin preparing the
route for its proposed 1,700-mile-long oil pipeline from western Canada to
Texas, even though the project hasn't gained final government approval, three
conservationist groups contend in a lawsuit filed Wednesday.

  
The U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service should not have allowed [ TransCanada Corp.
][3] to begin clearing a 100-mile corridor through northern Nebraska
grasslands because the [ State Department ][4] hasn't signed off on the
Keystone XL pipeline project, the groups argue in their lawsuit filed in
federal court in Omaha.

TransCanada was allowed to mow down delicate native grasses and to relocate an
endangered species living there, the American burying beetle, they say.

  
""It's our contention that that activity is illegal. They should not be
constructing the pipeline, and they should not be out there,"" Noah Greenwald,
the Center for Biological Diversity's endangered species director, said at a
news conference in Omaha.

  
The plaintiffs, who also include the Western Nebraska Resources Council and
Friends of the Earth, are seeking to stop the preparations for the proposed
pipeline, which would carry an estimated 700,000 barrels of crude per day from
the oil sands of Alberta, Canada, to Texas Gulf Coast refineries.

  
TransCanada spokesman Shawn Howard said the claims made in the lawsuit are
false and that it mowed some grass as part of efforts to protect and move some
of the protected beetles. In every case where mowing was done, the company
received permission from landowners, Howard said.

  
""We respect the regulated review process currently under way and in no way
would we impact that by beginning construction without a permit,"" Howard said
in a written statement.

  
Howard stressed that mowing doesn't constitute construction.

  
Pipeline supporters, including some business groups and unions, say it would
double the capacity of an existing pipeline from Canada and make the U.S. less
reliant on Middle East oil. They also say it would create jobs in the states
it would pass through -- Montana, South Dakota, Nebraska, Kansas, Oklahoma and
Texas.

  
In Nebraska, the pipeline has drawn opposition from an unlikely coalition of
farmers, ranchers, landowners, environmental groups and other activists who
fear it will leak and contaminate the Ogallala aquifer, which supplies
drinking and irrigation water to eight states.

  
Some climatologists have also argued that by increasing production from the
tar sands, the U.S. would begin a dramatic increase in the burning of carbon-
intensive fossil fuels at a time when it should be trying to reduce the
release of gases that contribute to global warming.

  
Earlier this week, opponents of the pipeline released emails and other
internal documents that they say demonstrate an overly cozy relationship
between State Department officials and TransCanada. The groups asked President
[ Barack Obama ][21] to intervene and block the pipeline project.

  
In their lawsuit, the conservationist groups say the decision to allow
TransCanada to begin preparing the proposed route for its pipeline shows that
federal officials aren't committed to the full, legally mandated review. State
Department officials held public meetings last week in the states the pipeline
would pass through, and have defended the process as fair.

  
""The State Department has further confirmed that it is running a corrupt
review process by giving TransCanada a green light to begin construction,""
said Erich Pica, president of Friends of the Earth. ""It makes a mockery of the
public and sends a message to Nebraska that their concerns don't matter. If
the State Department was truly doing its job, this lawsuit wouldn't be
necessary.""

  
By mowing and transplanting an endangered species, TransCanada has already
created environmental damage, said Bruce McIntosh, staff ecologist with the
Western Nebraska Resources Council.

  
""It's not just clearing. It's destruction,"" said McIntosh, who recently flew
over the mowed swaths to document the razing.

  
He also said the attempt to move the beetles, which have been on the
endangered species list since 1983, would result in some dying. The beetles
are now found in only six states: Nebraska, Rhode Island, Oklahoma, South
Dakota, Kansas, and Arkansas, according to [ University of Nebraska ][23]
-Lincoln entomologists.

  
Although the State Department has final say over the project because it
crosses international boundaries, some claim the state of Nebraska could
control the pipeline's route through the state.

  
That could yet happen. Hours after the announced lawsuit, Nebraska Speaker of
the Legislature Mike Flood announced that a group of Nebraska lawmakers will
meet next Tuesday with a TransCanada official to discuss concerns about the
proposed route of the Keystone XL pipeline through Nebraska..

A suspected carjacker being chased by police on the Dan Ryan Expy. early
Monday shot at the officers on his tail but didn’t hit anybody, authorities
said.

The chase began at about 2 a.m. in the 1000 block of South Normal when
officers recognized a gray Chevy van that had been stolen in a carjacking.

The van fled onto I-57, and then onto the Ryan. While fleeing, the driver
fired at the officers but missed.

The chase ended near East 31st Street and South King Drive when the van
crashed. The driver was taken into custody. Charges had not been filed as of
Monday evening.

Two police officers suffered minor injuries in a crash related to the chase,
police said.

October 13, 2011

The maxim that timing is everything was on display Wednesday as Mayor [ Rahm
Emanuel ][27] unveiled a tough-love budget that asks taxpayers, city workers
and aldermen to sacrifice to avoid harsher measures down the road.

  
The city is running deep in the red. The storehouse of financial tricks has
been greatly depleted. And the new mayor was elected with something resembling
a mandate for change.

  
All of which meant Emanuel was free to offer up a spending plan that would hit
up out-of-towners and suburbanites for more money, shutter three police
stations, cut library hours, overhaul garbage collection and double city water
bills for the average Chicago household by 2015.

  
Both in a 30-minute presentation to the City Council and later in speaking to
the Tribune editorial board, Emanuel prided himself for having the moxie to
make tough choices.

  
""I've taken on a tremendous amount of political sacred cows, walled off,
things that were taboo because of the political sign: 'Do not trespass.
Politically dangerous,'"" Emanuel told the Tribune. ""Not once, not twice, not
three times, not four times, but multiple times across the budget.""

  
Continuing the soliloquy, Emanuel launched into a lecture about how a decade
of deferred maintenance had left the city's financial house structurally
teetering. The freshman mayor returned again and again to the point that
""somebody"" could have acted earlier but didn't.

  
Left unsaid: the ""somebody"" was [ Richard Daley ][28] , who ran the city for
22 years before Emanuel took over. Though often professing admiration for
Daley, Emanuel indirectly ridicules Daley's stewardship with regularity,
transforming the former mayor into a political version of [ Harry Potter ][26]
's Lord Voldemort -- he who must not be named.

  
But the mess bequeathed by Daley has in many ways given an opening to Emanuel
to act more boldly than his predecessor when it comes to charting a financial
course for the city.

  
Laurence Msall, president of the watchdog Civic Federation that had grown
increasingly dismayed by budget manipulation under Daley that masked mounting
problems, praised Emanuel for resorting to ""much less reliance on gimmicks.""

  
""This is a great first step for a first budget and points the city in the
right direction,"" Msall said.

  
Emanuel said he viewed the budget as not just a financial document, but an
opportunity to carry through on campaign promises and demonstrate to taxpayers
grown cynical about government that their leaders can deliver.

  
""One of the things I'm also trying to do is re-establish a trust between the
public and those of us who do public service, not saying one thing on election
day and (then doing) another thing,"" the mayor declared.

  
That said, in wiping away a near $636 million deficit that loomed in the early
stages of the budget-making process, Emanuel resorted to occasionally
optimistic projections about how he can achieve savings. For instance, Emanuel
penciled in $33 million in extra revenue by banking on the city's ability to
be more successful in collecting bad debts.

  
Emanuel also counted on saving a like amount by beginning the phaseout of a
long-standing custom in which the city picked up the pension costs of some [
Chicago Public Schools ][22] employees. That presents city taxpayers with
something of a shell game, shifting more of the pension burden to CPS. The
school district, which recently hiked its property tax levy, will now cover a
greater portion of its pension burden.

  
In all, Emanuel laid out a blueprint for spending $6.3 billion next year, up
2.1 percent from the current budget. But, the critical portion of the budget
dedicated to day-to-day spending on city operations dropped 5.4 percent to
nearly $3.1 billion.

  
To help accomplish that, Emanuel laid out a broad series of spending cuts,
program revamps and fee increases. He did not ask the council to impose
increases in general taxes such as the sales or property tax.

  
Perhaps the most politically perilous proposal are the water and sewer fee
hikes. Bills on average homes would increase next year by about $92 for homes
with meters or $122 for those without. Those bills would continue to increase
in each of the next three years if aldermen sign off on the plan.

  
The mayor described some of his fee hikes as ""value propositions,"" meaning
taxpayers would get something for their money. The city would impose a
$2-a-day congestion fee for vehicles parked in downtown lots during the week.
The $28 million a year that would raise would be used to improve ""L"" stations,
build a new bus rapid-transit system and expand bicycle lanes, the mayor said.

  
Another potential flash point looms over the proposed closing of the Belmont,
Wood and Prairie District police stations, with their operations to be merged
into neighboring police facilities. Residents, even those in low-crime
neighborhoods, have jealously clung to the idea of a strong local police
presence, a reality that has made it politically difficult over the years to
redeploy officers to higher crime districts.

SIOUX CITY, Iowa--

Authorities say two animal-rights activists from Texas were arrested before
they could free minks from a Sioux City farm.

  
Sioux City Police Officer Jeremy McClure says 21-year-old Kellie Marshall and
24-year-old Victor Vanorden were arrested early Monday. Both are from Austin,
Texas.

According to the Sioux City Journal (http://bit.ly/optiOq), McClure says they
were found in a soybean field before they could release the animals. Officers
found fences nearby that had been cut.

  
A Woodbury County jailer said that both remained in custody Friday, pending
$5,000 bail each. Online court records don't list their attorneys' names.
Charges include burglary and criminal mischief.

  
Last week, authorities in Hamilton County reported that up to 1,500 minks were
released from pens and buildings at a residence in Jewell.

7:47 a.m. CDT  ,  October 26, 2011

For more than five years, Kevin Wilkins waited for the opportunity to look the
man who killed his teenage daughter in the eye and tell him about all the hate
he felt for him.

On Tuesday, that moment finally came as Wilkins took the witness stand during
the sentencing of Larry Barlow, who was convicted in June of fatally shooting
Wilkins' daughter, Antoinette Means, during a 2006 robbery at a South Side [
KFC ][12] restaurant where she worked.

But when Wilkins started to speak, it wasn't about hate or anger. It was about
something that he felt was far more powerful.

""Antoinette would have forgiven you and so have I,"" Wilkins said calmly to
Barlow, who was seated across the cramped courtroom. ""May God have mercy on
your soul.""

Not long after, Barlow, 51, shook his head and swiveled in his chair as Judge
Charles Burns sentenced him to 80 years in prison for the slaying. He had
declined to address the judge before the sentence was imposed. He must serve
100 percent of the time.

Means, 19, was valedictorian of her high school class, had earned a four-year
scholarship to college and was managing much older employees at the
restaurant. She was destined for big things, her father said. She hoped to be
a lawyer and dreamed of being a [ U.S. Supreme Court ][15] justice.

Prosecutors said Barlow stormed over the counter at the KFC restaurant at 83rd
Street and South [ South Chicago ][16] Avenue wearing a black bandana over his
face, brandishing a gun and demanding money.

As he fled with just $130, a worker in the kitchen yelled out, ""Coward,""
according to prosecutors. Barlow turned back and fired one shot, striking
Means in the chest.

She died while being cradled by her cousin, who also worked in the restaurant,
prosecutors said.

The judge said he was particularly angered that Barlow had recently been
released from prison at the time of the murder. He had previous convictions
for robbery, burglary and criminal sexual assault.

""He lasted less than four months on the street before he committed this
murder,"" Burns said. ""He is without question a career criminal. He is someone
we have to keep from society.""

Means' family said they will never understand why Barlow pulled the trigger
when he already had completed the robbery and was about to make his escape.

Means' murder was the second tragic loss for the family. Her 4-year-old half-
brother, Curtis Jones Jr., was killed in 1994 when two gangbangers threw a
Molotov cocktail through a window of their residence at the time, said Alicia
Jones, the mother.

Barlow's case took more than half a decade to wind its way to trial in part
because prosecutors were seeking the death penalty, but that became a moot
point after the [ Illinois General Assembly ][17] abolished capital punishment
this year.

In the 5 1/2 years since Means' death, the family has welcomed a baby who
would have been her sister as well as a nephew she would have loved to dote
on, her mother said. After attending dozens of court hearings for Barlow,
Jones said she was simply grateful that he would never be free again and
relieved that the process was over.

""I'm just so glad that my daughter got some closure today,"" Jones said.

For Wilkins, 42, there were many dark moments filled with thoughts of revenge.
Forgiving his daughter's murderer proved to be a long journey, one that he
never expected to lead to the place he's in now, he said.

""It's been hard. It has taken a long time, but I've finally been able to
forgive him because that is what God says to do,"" Wilkins said. ""I'd have
never been able to move on if I continued to hate him for what he did.""

[ Martin Luther King Jr. ][8]

By Liam Ford  Tribune reporter

9:04 p.m. CDT  ,  October 26, 2011

A Chicago man has been charged in the July shooting death of a man in the
Washington Park neighborhood, police said.

Kenyada Clair, 18, is accused in the slaying of a man later identified Lorenzo
Beasley, 25, of the 5200 block of South Prairie Avenue, according to police.

The victim was in a parked vehicle about 7 p.m. July 16, in the 5200 block of
South [ Martin Luther King ][8] Drive when a small grey sport utility vehicle
pulled up alongside the man, police aid at the time.

The driver of the SUV leaned out and fired multiple shots at the victim before
fleeing northbound on King Drive, police said at the time. The victim drove
north onto the parkway before crashing into a tree.

Clair, of the 7700 block of South Peoria Street, who is being held Cook County
Jail for what police said were unrelated charges, faces first degree murder
charges in Beasley's slaying.

Court records show Clair was arrested July 20 on charges including robbery and
unlawful posession of a stolen vehicle. He has since been charged with

By Annie Sweeney  Tribune reporter

A reputed ranking officer with the Outlaws motorcycle gang  was sentenced to
60 years in prison today in federal court for planning a mob-related bombing
in 2003 and authorizing a string of robberies and burglaries - the proceeds of
which were used to stock his pawn shop with stolen merchandise.

  
Mark Polchan was convicted last December by a federal jury with reputed mob
boss  Michael ""the Large Guy"" Sarno and three others.

  
The crew was convicted of bombing a rival Berwyn video poker business to
protect its lucrative illegal gambling operation, and fencing gems and other
merchandise stolen in a series of robberies and burglaries of jewelry stores
and other locations.

  
U.S. District Judge Ronald Guzman called Polchan's commitment to his criminal
life complete.

  
Polchan, 43, shook his head often during the sentencing and when he had an
opportunity to speak told the judge he was too ""overwhelmed"" to say anything.

  
Sarno is scheduled to be sentenced next month.

October 29, 2011

Eighteen-year-old [ Hampton University ][5] student Armand Browning was on
spring break and with two friends, cruising out from Oak Park in the passenger
seat of a Suzuki 4X4, when the three apparently crossed an unseen gang
boundary on Chicago's West Side.

Oscar Hernandez, an 19-year-old street gang member, allegedly sprayed at least
six bullets at the car, hitting Browning once in the head and killing him.
Hernandez quickly vanished and remains a fugitive today. The federal warrant
for him says his mother talked to police and told them Hernandez had probably
fled to [ Mexico ][8] , or maybe to California.

And today, more than 17 years after the April 1994 murder, Browning's family
members say they have not heard from Chicago police for years. Hernandez is
not on the [ Cook County ][7] state's attorney's list of active Mexican
extradition requests.

But Tribune reporters found Hernandez in El Estudiante, a riverside hamlet
less than an hour's drive south of the city of Cuernavaca. Hernandez lived in
a family-owned brick structure secluded behind a 10-foot-high wall and
surrounded by corn stalks and banana trees. After fleeing Chicago and arriving
here, reporters learned, Hernandez hooked up with a 14-year-old girl, and they
have two children that they registered with local civil authorities in June of
this year. No authorities have ever come looking for him, according to
neighbors, the common-law wife and other Hernandez relatives.

November 2, 2011

Charged with drunken driving and reckless homicide in an accident that killed
a 43-year-old single mother, Kyung Ho Song presented himself to the court as a
modest, $12,000-a-year shoe store manager. He was released after putting down
only a $2,500 bail bond deposit.

  
In fact, Song was a wealthy businessman who co-owned a strip mall, a suburban
home and other Chicago property worth a total of more than $1 million. After
he was charged, Song worked with his wife to liquidate those assets. Then he
retracted his guilty plea and later flew to his native [ South Korea ][14] ,
where he remains a fugitive, a Tribune investigation found.

  
Song was one of several border-crossing fugitives who were able to exploit a
fault line in Cook County's jampacked criminal justice system: Law enforcement
and court officials often conduct cursory investigations of felony defendants
when setting bond and assessing their flight risk, even when the accused is
charged with a serious crime and is a citizen of another country.

  
Police, Cook County prosecutors and other court officials handling Song's case
seemed unaware of Song's wealth and property deals, although his transactions
were registered publicly with the county recorder of deeds and other
government agencies.

  
Retired Cook County Criminal Court Judge Nicholas Pomaro, who did not set
Song's bail bond but handled much of the case, said he was surprised to learn
about Song's financial dealings from Tribune reporters. He said he would have
significantly increased Song's bond or revoked it altogether if law
enforcement officials had told him that Song was rapidly transferring property
to his family in the days after he was charged.

  
""I'd be terribly afraid of a flight risk,"" Pomaro said.

  
Song's deals also ensured that he would have access to hundreds of thousands
of dollars in cash when he landed in South Korea and helped shield his assets
from any potential lawsuit by the accident victim's family.

  
Since he fled in 1998, the 72-year-old Song has done little to conceal his
presence in South Korea. For reasons that are unclear, he phoned U.S.
authorities in 2001 to tell them he was living permanently in the Sungdong-gu
district of Seoul, according to an [ FBI ][23] agent's affidavit filed in
Chicago's federal court.

  
But there has been no visible progress in bringing Song to justice, even
though the U.S. and South Korea are close allies and have had an extradition
treaty since 1999.

  
Brenda Molina, whose mother, Sonia Naranjo, was killed when Song's vehicle
allegedly rammed the car Naranjo was trying to push to safety, told Tribune
reporters that she has not been contacted by police since the 1990s.

  
In their parting words, police told her not to expect justice, she added.
""They said, 'He is in Korea, so we can't do nothing.' ... That's crazy.""

  
Efforts to reach Song for comment were unsuccessful, and his family did not
respond to repeated requests from the Tribune.

  
Song came to the U.S. with his wife and three children in 1981, and by the
early 1990s, he owned two small but profitable shoe stores on Chicago's Far
South Side, records show.

  
In October 1996, when Song was charged with reckless homicide, he and his wife
were living in a spacious Schaumburg home and owned a Schiller Park strip mall
and a West Side building that housed their new store, Mister Madison Shoes,
according to records examined by the Tribune.

  
The woman Song allegedly killed also was a striving immigrant.

  
Born in the bustling Ecuadorean city of Guayaquil, Naranjo came to America at
21 and raised four children on her own in Chicago while laboring at factories
before working her way up to a job as manager of housekeepers at a suburban
Radisson hotel, according to her daughter.

  
Remembered as a high-spirited woman who loved to play bingo and dance, she was
heading to a casino with two friends close to midnight in October 1996 when
their station wagon broke down on Lake Street just west of Route 59 in
Bartlett. A car driven by Song hit them from behind as they tried to push
their vehicle to safety, police records show. Both of Naranjo's friends were
severely injured.

  
A test indicated Song's blood-alcohol level was nearly twice the legal limit
at that time, records show.

  
In the days after the crash, Song deeded property worth more than $1 million
to his wife, including the strip mall and Schaumburg home. Then he filed for
divorce, using the same attorney.

  
Yet other business and court records indicate Song and his spouse may have
used the legal separation as a ploy to shield their wealth.

  
Song's divorce records state that he and his wife stopped living together in
February 1995, when their marriage underwent an ""irretrievable breakdown,"" but
the couple paid $330,000 for the Schaumburg home six months later and are
listed in land records as husband and wife. They also used that jointly
purchased home as their address in November 1996 -- about a month after the
divorce petition was filed -- when they signed papers securing a $200,000 loan
as husband and wife.

  
Also contradicting the divorce papers, Song in 1997 told court officials that
he was married with three children, and ""the defendant indicated that his wife
and family are very supportive,"" court records show.

  
In 1998, while his trial was still pending, Song fled to South Korea,
government records show. The Tribune could not locate his wife.

  
County prosecutors said they do not have the resources to investigate the
financial status of felony defendants either before or after their bond
hearings, unless authorities have a specific reason to believe a defendant is
presenting false information to the court.

  
Naranjo's children said they were shocked to learn from Tribune reporters that
Song and his wife owned substantial property. The four Naranjo siblings were
awarded $8,250 apiece from their mother's $50,000 life insurance policy after
paying an attorney $17,000 to handle their family claim, probate court records
show.

  
During the months before Song fled the country, Brenda Molina submitted a
handwritten victim's impact statement to then-Judge Pomaro.

  
""First of all I want you to know judge that my mom was the best mom of the
whole universe,"" her statement said. ""She taught us how to respect, how to
depend on ourselves. We all loved her, which we still do.""

  
Years later, Molina said she finds it hard to believe that Song slipped away
so easily. Unlike the families of victims, homicide suspects have an easy
option, she said: ""Just leave the country; you're safe.""

Virginia Perillo wears her wedding rings at the wedding of her son.

#####  Article Extras

![Story Image][5]

Updated:  November 11, 2011 8:23AM

  
  

A parolee who fatally beat and robbed an elderly nurse in Bridgeport last
month used the dead woman’s engagement and wedding rings to propose to his
girlfriend, Cook County prosecutors said Thursday.

Raymond Harris, 36, showed the rings off at a party just hours after he
attacked Virginia Perillo in her garage in the 3300 block of South Parnell,
assistant state’s attorney Melissa Howlett said. In addition to her rings,
Harris also took Perillo’s purse, Howlett said.

Perillo, 73, was discovered by a neighbor in a pool of blood with severe head
injuries and defense wounds to her forearms on the night of Oct. 22. The
brain-dead woman died at Stroger Hospital two days later.

Harris, of Carpentersville, was arrested after investigators were able to
match his DNA to a bloody watch that he left inside a car in Perillo’s garage,
Howlett said.

Perillo had returned from visiting her ailing husband at an area hospital,
family members said. She was found lying face down next to a car that was
still running.

Harris went to a party with brand new clothes on the night of the attack and
presented the stolen rings to a friend and asked which one he should use to
propose, Howlett said. Harris allegedly used both in his proposal five days
later. Harris’ fiancee later turned the rings in to detectives and Perillo’s
family identified them as hers, Howlett said. Harris was arrested Tuesday.

Perillo, who worked for four decades at Rush University Medical Center, came
to the United States from the Philippines in 1971, her eldest son, John, said.
The day of her brutal assault, Perillo had spent the day attending church,
buying groceries and visiting an area hospital to check on her husband who
recently suffered a stroke, John Perillo said.

“That’s just wrong,” John Perillo said of Harris’ alleged proposal with his
mother’s rings. “If you wanted to take her rings, fine. But he didn’t have to
take it to another level. It’s unthinkable. She was a sweet woman. She
wouldn’t hurt a fly. I hope he gets what he deserves.”

Harris was paroled in May after serving 13 years of a 30-year sentence for his
1997 attempted murder and aggravated arson convictions, Howlett said.

In that case, Harris broke into a woman’s home, raped and beat her for several
hours, Howlett said. He also threatened that victim at knifepoint, cut her
neck and set three separate fires in the woman’s home, Howlett said. The woman
woke up with her legs on fire and suffered third-degree burns.

Just three weeks before that attack, Harris had been released from prison for
a 1993 armed robbery, vehicular invasion and burglary. In that case, Harris
brandished a gun at a woman getting outside of her car outside her home,
Howlett said.

Judge Peggy Chiampas noted how it was “particularly disturbing” that Harris
kept committing heinous acts following his prison stints and lambasted him for
having the “audacity” to use Perillo’s rings in his proposal.

Chiampas ordered Harris held without bail for murder and armed robbery.

Eduardo Castro Sr. (left) and his son, Eduardo Castro Jr.

Updated:  November 29, 2011 6:42PM

  
  

A 20-year Chicago Fire Department veteran allegedly pushed his nemesis and
then grabbed the young man’s arm so his son could repeatedly pummel the man’s
face, prosecutors alleged Tuesday.

Then, Eduardo Castro Sr., 48, and his namesake son continued punching and
kicking the 20-year-old man, who only moments before was pushing a stroller
with a friend’s baby inside, prosecutors said.

Saturday’s beating stemmed from an ongoing feud between the victim and
Castro’s son, according to attorney, Richard Friedman, who is representing
both Castros.

The elder Castro was only trying to stop the fight, Friedman told Judge Israel
Desierto Tuesday.

But Assistant State’s Attorney Erin Antonietti said the middle-aged
firefighter chauffeured his son to find the man and eagerly participated in
the attack in the 3200 block of South Aberdeen.

The victim had been walking with a group of friends and was pushing a child in
a stroller when the Castros and another person approached around 3:30 p.m.,
Antonietti said.

The targeted man, who recognized the car’s occupants from the neighborhood,
said Castro Sr. first addressed him by speaking to him in an “aggressive”
manner, Antonietti said.

The person who was with the Castros then told the man’s friends to cross the
street with the baby and kept an eye on the group to ensure they stayed put,
Antonietti said.

Castro Sr. allegedly shoved the man before the man pushed him back and tried
to run away. Castro Jr. then started throwing punches. Soon, both Castros were
assaulting the man, who was eventually thrown to the ground, Antonietti said.

During the assault, the man’s North Face jacket came off. Before jumping back
in the car and fleeing the scene, the younger Castro took the jacket that
contained cash, a wallet and cell phone, Antonietti said.

The victim, who drove himself to the hospital, suffered a broken nose. He also
had bruising, swelling and scratches on his back, according to a police
report.

Desierto ordered both men held in lieu of $75,000 bail for robbery and
aggravated battery. Castro Sr. was also charged with resisting arrest because
he started “flailing his arms” and pushed away when officers tried to take him
into custody, Antonietti said.

The elder Castro has had “multiple interactions” with the police, but he only
has two convictions for failure to appear in court for battery and indecent
exposure charges from the late 1980s, Antonietti said.

The younger Castro, who Friedman said works for a catering company, has a
prior conviction for unlawful use of a weapon. He completed probation
unsatisfactorily in that case in 2009, Antonietti said. Castro Jr., of the 280
block of South Eleanor, also has three misdemeanor convictions, which include
cannabis and disorderly conduct charges.

Castro Sr. is listed in a City of Chicago online database as a firefighter
earning a yearly salary of $79,926.

The firefighter is currently on furlough and is not expected back until mid-
December, Chicago Fire Department spokesman Larry Langford said.

Unless he’s cleared of all charges, the Fire Department will also initiate an
investigation and Castro Sr. would not be able to return to work, Langford
said.

After Tuesday’s hearing, the Castros’ relatives yelled at reporters covering
the case. Friedman would not elaborate on the ongoing conflict between Castro
Jr. and the victim. Moments earlier in court, he said the fight centered on
“damage to property.”

The Chicago Tribune and the [ Chicago Sun-Times ][1] have been subpoenaed by
attorneys for William Cellini, who are seeking notes, tape recordings and
other documents related to post-trial interviews with one of the jurors who
convicted the Springfield insider.

After doing a routine background check following Cellini's trial, the Tribune
had reported that the female juror did not disclose her own apparent past
felony convictions during jury selection. Felons are generally barred from
serving on federal juries.

Cellini's attorneys moved for a new trial following the conviction in November
in a scheme to trade political access for campaign contributions.

The Tribune and reporter Annie Sweeney received the subpoenas Friday. Sun-
Times outside council Damon Dunn confirmed Friday that the newspaper and two
of its reporters had received similar subpoenas, requesting notes and other
documentation related to conversations with the juror.

Cellini's attorneys could not be reached for comment.

""We intend to fight this subpoena because it constitutes an invasive and
unnecessary interference with the newsgathering process,"" said Chicago Tribune
editor Gerould Kern. ""Our attorneys will file a motion to quash on Monday
morning.""

An O’Hare Airport baggage handler faces several weapons charges after he
allegedly stole a gun from a Chicago police officer’s checked luggage.

Abdoulaye Barry, 23, of the 2400 block of North Kedzie, has been charged with
aggravated concealment of a weapon, unlawful use of a weapon, possession of
ammunition without a valid firearm owner identification card and failure to
possess the card, a Chicago police spokeswoman said.

Barry was arrested Wednesday evening about 8 p.m. when police pulled him over
and found the officer’s gun in a plastic bag in Barry’s front pants pocket,
Kubiak said. Police ran the serial number on the gun and found it had been
reported stolen by the officer sometime between Sunday and Wednesday.

Maribel Torres is identified in court records as Jose Torres. A special panel
will decide where Torres will serve a prison sentence.  (  HANDOUT  /  January
18  , 2012  )

By Brian L. Cox, Special to the Tribune

January 19, 2012

A gender identity committee will decide where a transgender woman with an
extensive criminal record will be housed after she was sentenced this week to
four years in prison on felony retail theft, battery and violation of
probation charges, authorities said.

  
Maribel Torres, identified in court records as Jose Torres, was sentenced
Tuesday at the [ Skokie ][2] courthouse to four years in the Illinois
Department of Corrections after pleading guilty to incidents in the women's
departments of stores in Skokie and [ Deerfield ][3] .

  
""She seems like she's headed in the right direction to me,"" said Cook County
Assistant Public Defender Lisa Ottenfeld, who represented Torres during the
hearing before Cook County Circuit Judge Timothy Chambers. ""She's come to
terms with a lot of her issues.""

  
Torres, 41, of Chicago, who has shoulder-length brown hair, was born a male.
But for more than 10 years Torres has identified as a woman, undergoing
hormone treatments to enhance her female appearance, authorities said.

  
Transgender prisoners have long presented challenges for the [ Cook County
][4] Sheriff's Department and the Illinois Department of Corrections,
according to a sheriff's department spokesman. Last March the state Department
of Corrections modified its policy on transgender prisoners.

  
The policy notes that the department's goal is to provide a safe and secure
environment for all inmates who identify themselves as transgender, or who are
identified by Cermak Health Services of Cook County as having gender identity
disorder. Cermak is the health care provider for county's Department of
Corrections.

  
Transgender prisoners can ask to be placed in the male or female section of a
prison, according to the policy, but the final decision is made by a gender
identity committee of medical staff and representatives from the Sheriff's
Department and Department of Corrections.

  
Torres was housed in the male section of the Cook County Jail after her arrest
last year, but was moved to a special unit in the jail where she received drug
and counseling services, Ottenfeld said.

  
Torres has 10 previous felony convictions. On Tuesday she pleaded guilty to
stealing a $2,000 Burberry handbag from a Skokie [ Nordstrom ][5] store in
2008, and knocking down a store security worker who tried to stop her,
Ottenfeld said.

  
Torres also pleaded guilty to stealing more than $1,000 worth of cosmetics
from a Deerfield store in 2009.

  
She was sentenced to three years in prison on each of the theft charges and
three years in prison on an aggravated battery charge, with the sentences to
run concurrently. She was also sentenced to an additional year in prison for
violating her parole on a previous conviction.

protect themselves from bogus allegations. Some departments are beginning to hav
e officers wear cameras on their uniforms, and they also are equipping stun guns
 with cameras. 

CBS 2′s Dave Savini looks at this new technology and the controversy around
it.

In a Minnesota police station, a man walked in bleeding from his neck; he had
cut his own throat, and was carrying a knife. An officer turned on what is
commonly called a “body camera” and captured all that happened before the man
could be apprehended.

The camera caught officers drawing their weapons, and repeatedly ordering the
man to drop the knife before they were able to subdue him.

Exactly what happened in this case is not in dispute, because it was all
captured by the police body camera.

One of the first police departments in Illinois to use body cameras is at
Benedictine University. Police there have been using body cameras to document
crime on campus since 2008.

""They know the camera is on,"" says Benedictine University Police Chief Mike
Salatino. ""And it changes everything.""

Chief Salatino says they use the cameras to catch illegal drug and alcohol use
on campus, criminal property damage, slip and fall injuries and other
problems.

Those cameras protect police, too, says Deputy Chief Paul Creekmore.

""It's a silent partner for the officer; in case there might be an allegation
against the officer, he acted improperly, he didn't do something or he did too
much,"" says Creekmore. ""It's all here on the videotape.""

The body cameras are similar to dashboard cameras, which are allowed in
Illinois.

However, some legal experts – including the American Civil Liberties Union –
say tough recording laws in the state might mean police body cameras could be
challenged in court as not being legal, especially if they have audio.

Some police departments, including the DuPage County Sheriff's Office, are
using cameras mounted on stun guns. Again, it records everything, taking out
the “he said, she said” aspect of a police confrontation.

CBS 2 contacted several companies that manufacture these cameras and found
they are having a hard time selling the cameras in Illinois, because of the
strict recording laws.

There are a variety of police departments using them. CBS 2 checked with
Chicago Police, and was told they are not using body cameras.

Benedictine University police disabled the audio recording portion of their
body cameras, because of Illinois' two-party consent law, which requires both
parties who might be recorded to authorize the taping of conversations.

12:44 p.m. CST  ,  March 6, 2012

A 27-year-old Chicago man was one of five computer hackers charged Tuesday for
crimes related to high-profile cyber attacks against major corporations and
government entities.

  
Jeremy Hammond was arrested late Monday in Chicago.

  
The [ Federal Bureau of Investigation ][1] confirmed that it raided a home in
the 2900 block of South Quinn in the Bridgeport neighborhood.

  
Authorities have been investigating [ Anonymous ][2] , a decentralized
international collective of ""hacktivists,"" or people who use computer networks
for political protests and other actions. Anonymous is connected to a number
of related groups, including LulzSec, Internet Feds and AntiSec.

  
According to federal authorities, Hammond identified himself as a member of
AntiSec. He was charged with counts of computer hacking conspiracy, computer
hacking and conspiracy to commit access device fraud. Authorities said he
conspired to hack into the computer systems of Stratfor, an Austin, Texas-
based intelligence firm that conducts geopolitical analysis for governments
and other clients, in December. Hammond and fellow AntiSec members stole
confidential information, including employee e-mails and account information
for about 860,000 Stratfor clients, according to authorities. They also
allegedly stole credit card information for about 60,000 users and made
$700,000 in unauthorized charges.

  
According to federal authorities, Hammond was known online by a variety of
monikers, including ""Anarchaos,"" ""tylerknowsthis"" and ""crediblethreat.""
AntiSec members had posted a document with links to the stolen Stratfor
information on a file-sharing website and called the document ""Anonymous
Lulzxmas rooting you proud,"" affirming their relationship with Anonymous,
authorities said.

During an appearance today in federal court in Chicago, Hammond was ordered
removed in custody to New York to face the federal hacking charges there.

After the hearing, as he stood in a narrow hallway, Hammond appeared curious.
He asked deputy marshals if he could keep a copy of the criminal complaint
since he had no idea about the charges until his arrest this morning.

His lawyer, James Fennerty, said he considers Hammond a likable man with
strongly held beliefs.

The Internet term ""lulz"" is a variant of ""LOL,"" the well-known abbreviation
for ""laughing out loud."" Lulz typically is used in connection with Internet
pranks and trolling or disruptive and inflammatory online behavior designed to
provoke emotional responses on forums such as message boards.

  
Other companies targeted by the hackers included [ Fox Broadcasting Co. ][3] ,
[ Sony Pictures Entertainment ][4] , Visa, MasterCard, and Paypal. The Chicago
Tribune was among a number of companies and organizations targeted for cyber
attacks, according to a source. However, the Tribune was not mentioned in the
U.S. Attorney's press release about the charges.

  
Tribune Co. spokesman Gary Weitman declined to comment.

  
Last month, the [ Tribune's Facebook page was flooded ][5] with hundreds of
comments calling for the media to fight for the release of Hamza Kashgari, a
jailed Saudi writer. Anonymous had directed its Facebook followers to post a
pre-written messages on the Tribune's Facebook page, as well as that of the
Wall Street Journal.

  
The message to the Tribune ended with this salutation: ""We are Anonymous. We
are millions. We do not forgive. We do not forget. Expect us!""

  
Hector Xavier Monsegur, a 28-year-old New Yorker and self-identified member of
Anonymous, Internet Feds and LulzSec, pleaded guilty to 12 criminal counts in
August. Federal court papers in his case were unsealed on Tuesday in New York,
revealing that he was connected to hacks of security firm HBGary, Sony
Pictures Entertainment, Fox Broadcasting Company and [ Public Broadcasting
Service ][6] .

  
Federal authorities said Anonymous has been operating since at least 2008,
taking responsibility for cyber attacks between December 2010 and June 2011.
Some of these attacks take the form of denial of service, or DoS, attacks,
which involve overloading a computer network so it can't provide its regular
service. The websites of Visa, MasterCard and PayPal were hit with DoS
attacks, as were foreign government computer systems.

  
Other attacks included stealing confidential information and making it public,
hijacking e-mail and Twitter accounts and defacing websites. Among the alleged
victims whose information was compromised were 70,000 potential contestants on
the Fox television show [ ""X-Factor,"" ][7] 100,000 users of Sony's website and
200,000 website users of [ Bethesda ][8] Softworks, a Maryland video game
company.

120312 cameras.mp3

In January, the Illinois Supreme Court [ approved the pilot project ][2] for
allowing cameras in the courtroom, with the following rules:

• Jurors and potential jurors may not be photographed.

• Cameras and recording devices will not be allowed in juvenile, divorce,
adoption, child custody and evidence suppression cases.

• No more than two television cameras and no more than two still photographers
will be allowed in a courtroom at one time.

• Victims of violent felonies, police informants and relocated witnesses may
request that the judge prohibit them from being photographed.

As drastic as this change might be for Chicagoland media, Illinois is jumping
on the bandwagon of a practice that's allowed in many other states. ""Until
now, Illinois has been one of only 14 states where cameras in trial courtrooms
were either dis-allowed or allowed on such a restrictive basis that they were
hardly utilized,"" [ said the Supreme Court in a press release ][3] . However,
""Illinois has allowed news cameras in the Supreme Court and the Illinois
Appellate Court since 1983,"" and audio and video of oral reports are posted
online.

The pilot program will be put in place in four counties -- Rock Island,
Mercer, Henry and Whiteside. WBEZ criminal justice reporter Robert Wildeboer
and Gene Borgida, a professor of psychology and law at the University of
Minnesota, talk with _ Eight Forty-Eight _ about the effect this will have on
the courts and on the media.

By Hal Dardick, Chicago Tribune reporter

10:18 p.m. CDT  ,  March 12, 2012

A key City Council committee Monday signed off on a $3.6 million settlement in
a lawsuit filed by a man who spent nearly 10 years in prison for an attack on
a woman who later said she made a mistake when she identified him as her
assailant.

Robert Wilson had sought $9.9 million, a figure reflecting the nine years and
nine months he spent behind bars on an attempted murder conviction before he
was released in 2006, said Leslie Darling, an attorney for the city. Wilson,
who alleged that his confession to the crime was coerced, was pardoned in 2008
by Gov. [ Rod Blagojevich ][2] .

""I think he deserves $10 million,"" said Ald. Proco ""Joe"" Moreno, 1st. ""In this
case, I think approving the $3.6 million is a cost-saving measure and quite
prudent.""

The Finance Committee also endorsed a $125,000 settlement for two brothers who
alleged they were beaten by police responding to a 2007 hit-and-run crash. The
full council will vote Wednesday on both settlements.

If the deals are approved, Mayor [ Rahm Emanuel ][3] 's administration will
have settled nine cases involving alleged police misconduct for a total of
$9.4 million since September. All the alleged misconduct -- ranging from
improper response to medical needs to railroading innocent defendants --
occurred during the 22-year tenure of former Mayor Richard Daley.

In none of the cases did the city admit wrongdoing. Darling said the proposed
settlement in the Wilson case ""is a cost-effective measure to limit the city's
financial exposure.""

Locke Bowman, Wilson's lawyer in his lawsuit, said the city settles cases when
the evidence is against them.

""I have the impression that they settled the Robert Wilson case because it was
overwhelmingly clear that Robert Wilson was the victim of police misconduct,""
said Bowman, who is also the director of the MacArthur Justice Center at
Northwestern University's law school. ""They don't settle cases because they
have a higher principle in mind. They settle cases because they have to.""

Wilson was convicted and sentenced to 30 years in prison for the slashing
attack on a woman at a South Side bus stop in 1997. The next day, he was
arrested at the bus stop with a loaded gun and knife.

His build fit the description of the attacker, but he was older and no
physical evidence linked him to the crime. Another man -- who had a similar
build, was closer to the age of the assailant and later confessed to a series
of similar attacks in the area -- was arrested less than two weeks later.

Wilson gave a confession but said he did so because he was held for 30 hours,
threatened and denied his blood-pressure medication, Darling said. Wilson
alleged that he became ill and feared for his life during the detention, she
said. The victim, June Siler, later recanted her identification of Wilson.

Darling said two officers involved in the case now are Wentworth Area
detectives. Another is a police sergeant assigned to the [ FBI ][4] . Another
died, and the rest retired, she said, adding that the incident is being
investigated by the Independent Police Review Authority.

Staff report

12:11 p.m. CDT  ,  March 13, 2012

The dog was right: it wasn't just a couple yogurt drinks and a bottle of
chocolate milk in the cooler.

  
After narcotics officers followed and stopped Cecelia Yanez, of Mission,
Texas, Monday morning, a police dog indicated a cooler Yanez had in her car
might have drugs in it, according to police.

  
Officers pried open the cooler's sides and found more than 4 pounds of [
methamphetamine ][3] and $80,000 in cash hidden in the walls of a cooler,
according to a police news release.

  
Narcotics Division officers were tipped that someone might be transporting
methamphetamine from Texas to Chicago, and on Monday they began surveillance
of Yanez.

  
They saw Yanez take the cooler from a hotel on or near the Southwest Side, and
take it to a residence in the 5000 block of South Maplewood Avenue, according
to police.

  
Officers stopped Yanez about noon, and after they opened the cooler, they
found two plastic-wrapped kilogram packages of methamphetamine, worth about
$750,000 at current street-drug prices, and about a dozen plastic-wrapped
bundles of cash, including $20, $50 and $100 bills, hidden in the cooler's
hollowed-out sides.

  
Yanez also was cited with several traffic violations and was expected to
appear in bond court today, police said.

, wine and hard liquor.

The change in policy is expected to generate an additional $3.2 million for
the cash-strapped agency. CTA President Forrest Claypool said advertising
broker Titan Worldwide already has ad buyers lined up.

The new policy, which takes effect immediately, still bars alcohol-related ads
aboard buses. It also limits the ads to 'L' stations between Montrose and
Roosevelt, Ashland and the lakefront. There is an exception that allows
alcohol ads at the Green and Red Line stations on 35th Street, near U.S.
Cellular Field. And up to 30 'L' cars will be outfitted with alcohol-related
ads at any given time.

The ads also will continue to be barred at 'L' stations that have a high
number of students as riders.

_**LISTEN: WBBM Newsradio’s Bob Roberts reports**_

Claypool said he believed the change is being made in a ""very responsible
way,"" and said the restrictions were discussed with the Rev. Michael Pfleger,
who spearheaded the drive to halt such advertising on CTA buses, trains and
'L' stations 15 years ago.

""I'm not one who likes any alcohol advertising, but I was glad to hear that
they're not going to do any on any buses, which is the primary thing that's
ridden by students,"" Pfleger said.

Ironically, one of Pfleger's staunchest supporters in instituting the ban 15
years ago was then-Ald. Terry Peterson, now CTA board chairman.

The ads must state the legal drinking age and include warnings about the
dangers of drinking alcohol. Pfleger said he had an assurance from CTA and
Titan that they would not promote alcohol-laden energy drinks.

Claypool said the additional revenue will allow CTA a bit more breathing room
in its negotiations with its unions on contract concessions. CTA has been in
negotiations with the unions in an attempt to achieve $80 million in
concessions by July 1.

Massive fare hikes and service cuts are expected if the talks fail to achieve
the needed reductions in expenses.

""It's, as you might expect, two steps forward and one step back"" with the
contract negotiations, Claypool said.

The change in policy does not affect bus shelters, which are managed by JC
Decaux under a separate contract with the Chicago Dept. of Transportation.
Decaux has sold alcohol advertising since erecting the shelters.

The CTA's board also changed its policies governing political and public
service ads by non-profit groups and government agencies, requiring them to
spell out clearly who is sponsoring the ad so that it is clear CTA is not
endorsing candidates or specific programs.

It also will require organizations that have been granted free use of
unutilized ad space aboard 'L' trains and buses to purchase an equal amount of
advertising, effective May 1.

When a party gave way to a fight in the street in the [ Gresham ][1]
neighborhood this weekend, a Chicago woman jumped into an SUV and drove off
before whipping a U-turn, accelerating and plowing into the crowd, breaking a
woman's shoulder and knee, prosecutors said.

Denise Carter's blood-alcohol content was 0.175 percent, more than twice the
legal limit, when she was arrested early Saturday morning in the 8200 block of
South Wood Street in the Gresham neighborhood, prosecutors said. On Sunday
morning, Cook County Judge James Brown ordered Carter held on $125,000 bond.

Carter, who is charged with aggravated drunken driving and various traffic
offenses, was also charged with drunken driving in Cook County in August,
according to court records. That case is pending.

As the street fight raged early Saturday, Carter got into a Chevy TrailBlazer
and drove away, according to a police report. But she pulled a U-turn, drove
the wrong way on the one-way street, sped up and drove into the group, police
said. All the combatants jumped out of the way except a 37-year-old woman, who
suffered a broken left knee and left shoulder, police said.

The woman who was hit had been trying to resolve the argument that sparked the
fight, police said.

Carter, of the 8200 block of South Marshfield Avenue, was pulled from the SUV
and attacked by bystanders after the crash, authorities said. She told
officers she didn't intend to hit the woman, and that she was trying to escape
the fight when the woman jumped in front of her vehicle.

Registered nurse Jeffrey Pecoraro worked at Rush SurgiCenter last year, and
said he saw nurses operate X-ray equipment they were not authorized to use.
His complaints led to a state agency's investigation.  (  Kevin P. Casey, for
the Chicago Tribune  /  February  28  , 2012  )

By Deborah L. Shelton, Chicago Tribune reporter

6:00 a.m. CDT  ,  March 21, 2012

Two [ nurses ][2] and Rush SurgiCenter have been fined by a state agency for
violating radiation protection regulations after an investigation found that
the nurses operated X-ray equipment they were not supposed to use.

  
By Illinois law, radiologic equipment must be operated by health professionals
licensed under the state Medical Practice Act, including chiropractors,
dentists, podiatrists and veterinarians, or by a certified radiologic
technologist, also called a radiographer.

  
The civil penalty from the Illinois Emergency Management Agency comes amid
growing national concern about overexposure to medical radiation, including
highly publicized cases in which patients were injured or died after
undergoing CT scans and other radiologic procedures. Some patients were
overdosed as a result of human error.

  
Donald Agnew, chief of the agency's electronic products section, which
regulates equipment that uses radiation, characterized the violation at Rush
SurgiCenter as ""fairly serious"" and said the facility was fined $2,000 and the
two registered nurses $500 each. The penalties, levied in January, were paid
by the outpatient facility, which is affiliated with [ Rush University Medical
Center ][3] and located in the medical center complex.

  
""I don't think there's any impact to the patients, but we do take it seriously
because we believe these machines ought to be operated by people who are
trained and credentialed to do so,"" Agnew said. ""Radiation is potentially
dangerous. People who are using these machines ought to know what they are
doing.""

  
Rush SurgiCenter administrator Barbara Ramsey said the facility has made
changes in scheduling, staffing and training to make sure the violation
doesn't happen again.

  
Even before the fines, Ramsey said, staff were required to wear a radiation
reader, called a dosimeter, that records radiation levels in the room. She
said it is monitored quarterly to ensure that overexposure is not occurring.

  
""Patient safety and the safety of the staff is paramount,"" Ramsey said, ""and
anytime anything is reported to us it is thoroughly dissected down to the
bottom line. This is something we do not take lightly here.""

  
The violations involved a fluoroscope, a type of X-ray device. During a
fluoroscopy procedure, patients are positioned on a table and a physician or
radiographer presses either a button or a foot pedal to release an X-ray beam
that passes through the body while a continuous image is transmitted to a
monitor. Radiation doses vary depending on the size of the patient as well as
the length of the exposure.

  
At Rush, Ramsey said, the procedure is done with a piece of equipment called a
C-arm, which has an X-ray tube that can be positioned above or below the
patient to take images from different angles. She said the machine is used for
hip procedures and for procedures involving pain management.

  
The two major risks of fluoroscopy are radiation-induced burns to the skin and
underlying tissues, and the small possibility of a radiation-induced [ cancer
][4] , said Myke Kudlas, chief academic officer for the American Society of
Radiologic Technologists. He said improper settings on the equipment also can
result in images of poor quality, possibly missing vital information.

  
The Illinois Emergency Management Agency inspected the facility in December
after receiving a complaint from an operating room nurse who said he witnessed
a nurse running a fluoroscope on two separate occasions.

  
Registered nurse Jeff Pecoraro, who worked in one of Rush SurgiCenter's four
operating rooms, said he saw a nurse operate a fluoroscope in August and
immediately reported the incident to facility administrators but was not
satisfied that appropriate action was being taken. He said he saw a second
nurse operate the machine in October and filed a complaint with the state
Emergency Management Agency in November.

  
""These people have licenses and a responsibility to be advocates for patients,
and they are doing the opposite of what they are trained to do,"" said
Pecoraro, who was fired from Rush in December and now works in the Seattle
area. ""It's sad that this was allowed to happen.""

  
Ramsey disputed that problems occurred in August and October. She said that,
more than three years ago, a physician on two occasions had directed a nurse
to push a button to activate one of the facility's two fluoroscopes. In both
cases, she said, a doctor adjusted the settings and was present and no patient
was harmed.

  
""Two separate nurses pushed the button when told to do so even though it was
against policy,"" Ramsey said, adding that she was unaware of the incidents
until after the state agency's investigation was concluded.

  
Agnew said Ramsey had acknowledged to an investigator that violations occurred
but said the agency did not determine when the incidents took place.

  
The agency investigates ""a few"" cases each year that involve personnel with
lapsed credentials using radiologic equipment, but cases involving unqualified
personnel operating the equipment are rare, Agnew said.

  
Kudlas said it can be tempting for some health facilities to use nurses to
operate radiologic equipment because it is more convenient for them.

  
""People are being asked to do more with less,"" he said, ""and this is one place
where people feel they can cut corners, and they really shouldn't be.""

7:25 p.m. CDT  ,  March 22, 2012

After a quick chase down an alley and through a vacant lot, Chicago Police
Officer Del Pearson finally had the 20-year-old suspect cornered on a front
porch.

  
As Pearson approached the house in the South Chicago neighborhood Monday
night, Paris Sadler pointed a gun at him and fired at least twice, prosecutors
say. The tactical officer was hit in the shoulder and in his bullet-proof vest
and fell to the ground.

  
Holding his shoulder, Pearson shot back at Sadler, who fired at the officer
again and missed, prosecutors say. Pearson kept shooting as Sadler jumped off
the porch and ran toward his basement apartment nearby where he stashed the
gun behind a bathtub and changed his clothes, according to prosecutors.

  
Witnesses helped police track down the alleged gang member, and today a judge
ordered him held without bail on attempted murder of a police officer and
other charges, calling him ""a danger to himself and society.""

  
The bullet pierced a main artery in Pearson's upper shoulder and he underwent
hours of surgery at Advocate Christ Medical Center in Oak Lawn to stop the
bleeding, officials say. The bullet remains lodged in his neck, near his
spine.

  
Also today, Superintendent Garry McCarthy went to the hospital to visit
Pearson, who had his wife, two children and other family members at his side.
He said Pearson is in pain but is able to speak and even walk a little bit.

  
After seeing Pearson Monday night, McCarthy said he wasn't sure the officer
would survive.

  
""The fact that he is where is, it's great,"" McCarthy said.

  
The other bullet was retrieved from Pearson's vest and matched a .38-caliber
revolver found in a hole in the wall behind the bathtub, police said.

  
The shoot-out began at about 10:45 p.m. Monday when Pearson and his partner
pulled up in their unmarked SUV to four people causing some sort of a
""juvenile disturbance"" near 85th Street and Kingston Avenue, authorities said.

  
Sadler ran from the group, clutching his waistband, prompting Pearson to jump
from the squad car and run after him, said Cook County Assistant State's
Attorney Peter O'Mara.

  
Once he spotted a gun on Sadler, Pearson shouted at him and ordered him to
drop it, O'Mara said. ""Gun. Gun. He has a gun. Put down the gun,"" Pearson
yelled, according to O'Mara. But Sadler kept running through an alley.

  
Sadler, still trying to shake off Pearson, ran up to a porch at the home of a
neighbor, 30-year-old Paris Fortune, and started knocking on his front door,
O'Mara said.

  
""As (Sadler) banged on the door, he yelled, 'Bro, bro, let me in!' "" O'Mara
said in court.

  
Fortune saw Sadler sticking his arm through the bars of one of the doors as
well as a flashlight shining outside, O'Mara said, and refused to let him in.
When Pearson caught up to Sadler, the 20-year-old pointed his .38-caliber
revolver at Pearson, shot him fired, then fled, O'Mara said.

  
Chicago police officers on the scene had a physical description of the
shooter, and learned that Sadler had run to the basement of his home a few
doors away, O'Mara said. When the officers went to the house, Sadler's mother
called his cell phone and told him to come upstairs because the police were
there, O'Mara said.

  
Wearing only a pair of shorts and sweating profusely, Sadler told the officers
once they arrived that he was talking on the phone with his girlfriend,
according his arrest report. His mother then allowed the officers to search
the house, and they discovered a revolver in the inner wall of the basement
tub, the report stated.

  
The Illinois State Police Forensic Laboratory examined the bullet recovered
from Pearson's vest and determined it was shot from that revolver, O'Mara
said. He said Sadler also gave a handwritten statement admitting to shooting
the officer.

  
On his [ Facebook ][12] page, Sadler makes a reference to apparently being
part of ""EBK,"" which means ""Every Body Killers""--a group of gang members
aligned with one another, but still come from many other different gangs, law
enforcement sources said. However, his arrest report stated that he's
affiliated with the Black P. Stones street gang.

  
Police also arrested Fortune, a convicted felon, when a search warrant at his
home revealed that he had a 9mm handgun, O'Mara said. He was charged with
unlawful use of a weapon by a felon. Judge Maria Kuriakos Ciesel set his bail
Thursday at $125,000

is being ordered to give money back to some of its customers.

The punishment has taken years -- and a long investigation – from CBS 2’s Pam
Zekman.

The owners of Road America Towing in Blue Island and other towing companies
they operated apparently did not produce records as ordered by a judge in a
consumer-fraud complaint.

As a result, a default judgment orders them to pay $2.3 million dollars in
penalties for intentionally defrauding accident victims.

""This is like modern-day highway robbery,” Cook County State’s Attorney Anita
Alvarez says. “It's terrible to have these companies that are preying on
people at a very vulnerable time.""

Like Edward Nance, who complained to CBS 2 in 2008 about a $2,000 bill full of
inflated and fraudulent fees.

Now, the company is ordered to pay back more than $59,000 to some victims.

And the judgment bans the Al Hindi family that operates the companies from the
accident towing business for five years.

An attorney for the towing companies says he is appealing the judgment.

He says his clients lost the records requested by the state’s attorney’s
office and the county attorneys could have gotten the information from other
sources. He also says his clients did not intentionally defraud any accident
victims, and says any money they charged was justified.

After hearing oral arguments in a mother's request for a special prosecutor to
investigate her son's 2004 death, a Cook County judge on Thursday said a
decision will come in about a week's time.

""He was the most important person in the world to me, and I just want to know
that it's going to be handled fairly,"" Nanci Koschman said through tears after
the hearing.

Koschman want the prosecutor to determine whether Chicago police covered up
evidence or the Cook County State's Attorney's office had any conflict on
interest in the case. Her son, [ David Koschman ][1] , died after he was
punched on a Chicago street.

Koschman's family has long claimed that Richard J. ""R.J."" Vanecko, a nephew of
former Mayor Richard M. Daley, delivered the punch that led to the Mount
Prospect man's death. David Koschman's death was ruled a homicide, but no one
was ever charged.

Earlier this week, Vanecko formally entered the legal battle surrounding the
years-old death.

      
His lawyers on Monday filed a motion to intervene on a request for a special
prosecutor in the case and disputed the suggestion by Nanci Koschman's lawyers
that Vanecko may have confessed to throwing a punch that night.

sheds light on a North Chicago man's confrontation with police.

Darrin Hanna died a week after being arrested on a domestic battery charge.

His family says the tape is more evidence officers caused his death and after
an emotional outburst at a North Chicago City Council meeting, Hanna's mother
was led out of the room.

The coroner ruled Hanna's death was the result of a combination of drugs,
trauma and poor health as well as the use of a stun gun by officers and
prosecutors say police used reasonable force.

Hanna's family disputes those findings and the Lake County State's Attorney
says there's not enough evidence officers crossed the line and has declined to
file charges.

The family has not been deterred and they plan to file a federal lawsuit
against the North Chicago Police Department and the officers involved.

Among the evidence is an audio recording of the confrontation.

The calm quiet of a city council meeting was shattered when a mother saw
photos of her son in the minutes after a November confrontation with North
Chicago Police.

Hanna's relatives also played for council members a police recording their
attorneys obtained under a freedom of information act request.

""The story that's come out is that he was the aggressor and they were in fear
of their lives which, when you listen to the this tape, Darrin Hanna is
begging for his life and the officers are very calm and cool and collected,""
said Hanna family attorney Kevin O'Connor.

Police were responding to reports Hanna was beating is pregnant girlfriend.
They insist his injuries were the direct result of his own belligerence.

The coroner's report concluded that multiple hits with a stun gun, plus
physical trauma at the hands of officers contributed to Hanna's death as did
pre-existing conditions including cocaine use and hypertension.

A state police review of the incident concluded the officers used reasonable
force.

Monday night, North Chicago's mayor and interim police chief say this is the
first they've heard that audio of the incident was caught on police radio.

""When the tape was brought to our attention, naturally you want to go back and
talk to the officers and review the contents of that tape and we're in the
process of doing that,"" said North Chicago interim police chief Jackson.

Hanna's family told the city council they've seen no urgency in the suburb's
own investigation. ""I need an answer about the police officers,"" said Hanna's
mother, Gloria Carr. ""What are you going to do? It's been over four months. I
can't take this any long.""

There were several minutes of police audio tapes given to Hanna's attorney.

It's not clear if that's the complete version of the tapes.

The six officers, meanwhile, remain on desk duty.

North Chicago's interim police chief promises their own internal investigation
will be completed, and the officers' fates decided, next week.

5:12 p.m. CDT  ,  April 24, 2012

A Northwest Side man is accused of stealing $1.7 million in ""high end""
computer parts from [ Hewlett-Packard ][3] and selling them on the Internet,
police said.

  
Alexis Ortega, 31, was arrested Monday at his home in the 4900 block of North
Spaulding Avenue in the Albany Park neighborhood. He was charged with theft of
more than a million dollars and money laundering, and is expected to appear in
court today, police said. Ortega was ordered held in lieu of $50,000 bail in a
hearing before Cook County Criminal Court Judge Laura Sullivan today, said
Lisa Gordon, a spokeswoman for the Cook County state's attorney's office.

  
The theft was discovered after an internal investigation by Hewlett-Packard,
which then went to the Illinois State Police in March.

  
The company filed a criminal complaint accusing Ortega of using internal HP
accounts to send computer components valued at $2,000 to $6,000 each to his
home, police said. He then would sell them on the Internet through [ eBay ][4]
and private buyers, causing the company to lose about $1.7 million, police
said.

  
After being paid through a [ PayPal ][5] account, Ortega would launder the
money through his own [ Bank of America ][6] accounts, police said.

  
It's unclear how long Ortega had allegedly been doing this.

  
During interviews with HP authorities on Feb. 28, Ortega offered to pay
$124,000 back to HP but did not admit guilt, police said. A few days later,
some parts Ortega still had in his possession -- and worth about $200,000 --
were returned to the company, police said.

  
There was no immediate comment from Hewlett-Packard this morning.

Drew Peterson is escorted out of the Will County Courthouse in Joliet, Ill.,
after his arraignment was postponed in May 2009.  (  Zbigniew Bzdak, Chicago
Tribune  /  May  8  , 2009  )

By Stacy St. Clair  Tribune reporter

4:40 p.m. CDT  ,  April 24, 2012

[ Drew Peterson ][2] is ending the protracted battle over hearsay statements
and is signaling he's ready to go to trial in the slaying of his ex-wife
Kathleen Savio.

In a motion sent to the Third District Appellate court today, Peterson's
attorneys say they will not fight a recent higher court ruling allowing
prosecutors to use previously excluded hearsay statements at the former
Bolingbrook police officer's murder trial.

The defense asks that the appellate court send the case back to Will County
courts as soon as possible, essentially waiving the 35-day waiting period to
formalize a ruling.

The move reflects a renewed effort by the defense to downplay the significance
of the hearsay statements, which prosecutors say will allow Peterson's ex-
wives' to speak from the grave.

""We are not appealing because we want to get this case moving,"" Peterson
attorney Joel Brodsky said. ""Drew has been locked up long enough and we are
ready to go to trial.""

Will County spokesman Charles Pelkie said prosecutors are ""ready to move
forward at trial. The sooner the better. We're ready to go.""

The trial, which prosecutors said could begin as early as this spring, has
been postponed almost two years while appeals over the statements from
Peterson's drowned ex-wife,  Savio  , and missing fourth wife, [ Stacy
Peterson ][3] , wound their way through the higher courts.

During the appeals, the trial court judge retired and a [ Lifetime ][4] movie
about the case starring [ Rob Lowe ][5] as Peterson was made and aired to
stellar basic cable ratings.

Peterson, 58, is charged with killing Savio, who was found dead in her dry
Bolingbrook bathtub in 2004. Her death was ruled an accidental drowning, but
prosecutors exhumed Savio's body and reopened the case after Peterson's fourth
wife vanished in 2007.

Peterson remains the sole suspect in Stacy's disappearance but has not been
charged. He has denied any wrongdoing in either case.

Will County State's Attorney James Glasgow largely has built his case around
pathology reports and 14 hearsay statements that he says would allow Savio and
Stacy to speak from the grave. He even pushed for a new Illinois statute --
dubbed Drew's Law and passed in 2008 -- that he argued was needed to ensure
the statements could be heard.

A three-judge panel of the Third District Appellate court ruled earlier this
month that while Judge Stephen White correctly applied the new law, the
statute itself was ""manifestly erroneous"" and superseded by existing -- and
much broader -- Supreme Court rules of evidence.

It found that eight statements excluded by the trial judge are allowed under
existing Illinois common law, which does not require safeguards for
reliability.

approaches, and they will be getting a lot of help from all over the country.

As CBS 2’s Susanna Song reports, Chicago Police will get help from out of
state agencies, which include Milwaukee, Philadelphia, and Charlotte, N.C.

Also, several hundred Illinois State troopers will be helping out this
weekend.

They will all be under the command and rules of Chicago Police.

_**LISTEN: WBBM Newsradio Political Editor Craig Dellimore reports**_

Meantime, the Police Department is also taking steps to keep more of its own
officers on the streets in the neighborhoods, as well as handling security for
the summit.

Starting in the wee hours of Friday morning, Chicago police officers will
begin working longer hours to handle the NATO summit at McCormick Place, and
the demonstrations against it.

“We’re going to 12-hour tours, and cancelling days off,” McCarthy said. “As a
result of that, that frees up about one-third of the department to deal with
the [summit.]”

The superintendent said none of that means the neighborhoods will be
neglected.

“This actually results in a 15 percent increase in the number of officers
assigned in the neighborhoods,” he said. “So, the same officers who would do
an 8-hour tour are now going to be doing a 12-hour tour, in the same districts
that they’re working in today.”

[Speaking to CBS 2 Chief Correspondent Jay Levine on Monday, police McCarthy
said new tactics also will be in place for the summit.][1]

He says his officers are not coming out in helmets and riot gear, and such
items will not be used unless absolutely necessary.

“There are people who are intent to come and commit crimes, and our
expectation is that we're going to arrest those folks and protect and
facilitate the marches and speeches that other people want to do,” McCarthy
said.

He declined to say whether his department or its partner agencies have
identified specific individuals or groups intent on causing trouble as world
leaders meet at McCormick Place.

“We are doing everything we can to ensure that we facilitate the public
safety. Some of those methods are covert right now and I can't talk about
them,” McCarthy says.

Some of the protesters authorities will monitor are those dressed in black
from head to toe, with bandanas covering their faces -- the unofficial uniform
of those with a history of violence at past international gatherings.

McCarthy says he plans to employ a strategy based on surgical strikes rather
than massive force. He says putting up the “right front"" and dealing with
protesters in a low-key way will encourage demonstrators to likewise be
peaceful toward officers.

“You’re not going to see police charging wholesale into a crowd, you’re not
going to see tear gas,” McCarthy says.

He says his department is not interested in dispersing crowds, but he wants
officers to be able to “extract people who need to be extracted.”

Surrounded by his attorneys, Bennie Starks speaks to the media after his court
case was dismissed in the Lake County Courthouse in Waukegan today.  (  Stacey
Wescott, Chicago Tribune  /  May  15  , 2012  )

By Dan Hinkel  Tribune reporter

1:00 p.m. CDT  ,  May 15, 2012

Lake County prosecutors have dropped rape charges against Bennie Starks, who
spent 20 years in prison before [ DNA ][2] pointed away from him.

Assistant State's Attorney Jim Newman appeared at a brief hearing and dropped
the sexual assault charges.

""He is a free man and he is not guilty,"" said Starks' lawyer, Jed Stone.

Starks, dressed in a burgundy sport coat and black and white checked shirt,
accepted a hug around the shoulder from another of his lawyers, Vanessa Potkin
from the New York-based Innocence Project.

""This has been a great day,"" Starks said.

As to his plans, he said, ""Spend time with my grandkids and just...living.""

Starks, 52, of Chicago was convicted in 1986 of raping a 69-year-old woman in
Waukegan. He was in the middle of a 60-year sentence when the appeals court
ordered a new trial in 2006 and he was released on bond. As with three other
recent Lake County cases, prosecutors insisted on his guilt even after DNA
pointed toward someone else as the attacker.

The possibility of a retrial had been thrown into doubt by court rulings
barring prosecutors from using the testimony of the victim, who identified
Starks as the rapist.

She died several years ago, and a Lake County judge ruled in January 2011 that
prosecutors could not use her past testimony at the retrial.

The state appeals court affirmed that decision in February, writing that
Starks' lawyers would not have a fair shot at cross-examining her and holding
that the original cross-examination was inadequate.

Since February's ruling, Starks has waited to learn whether prosecutors
planned to retry him.

After the conflicting DNA evidence became public in the early 2000s,
prosecutors responded much as they did to other cases involving forensic
evidence suggesting a suspect's innocence.

Prosecutors argued that the DNA did not clear Starks because the woman could
have had consensual sex with someone else, although she said at trial she had
not had sex in the weeks before the attack.

The woman identified him as the man who pulled her into a ravine and beat, bit
and raped her. A dentist said bite marks on the victim matched Starks, and his
jacket was found at the scene.

Starks said the jacket and money were stolen from him after he passed the
evening in a local tavern, and the defense attorneys have called the
scientific rigor of the bite-mark evidence into question.

In the early 2000s, testing turned up a [ genetic ][3] profile from another
man on the victim's underwear. Later, testing on a vaginal swab found DNA that
didn't come from Starks, and the appeals court ordered a new trial in 2006.

This morning, it first appeared that Starks' wait to have his name cleared
might continue.

Newman, the assistant state's attorney, surprised Starks' defense lawyers at
the start of today's hearing when, instead of immediately dropping the
charges, he asked for a continuance while the appeals court considers Stark's
challenge to his battery conviction. Starks hopes to see that conviction --
which stems from the same crime -- wiped from his record.

Without pause, Judge John Phillips tersely declined that request and told
prosecutors to make a decision on retrying Starks immediately. Newman left
court for a few minutes to consult with his superiors, then returned to begin
filling out paperwork for Starks' case before the judge returned.

Stone, one Starks lawyers, approached Newman as he filled out a court form and
smiled as he said, ""That's N-O-L-L-E,"" a reference to the Latin phrase, _
nolle prosequi _ , which indicates a prosecutor is dropping charges.

When Phillips returned, Newman dropped the charges and hurried from the
courtroom. He declined to comment on the decision.

Sexual assault charges were dropped Tuesday against a man who served 20 years
for a 1985 rape in Waukegan.

In January 1985, a 69-year-old woman was walking in her neighborhood when she
was attacked and sexually assaulted. She was hospitalized for 11 days after
the attack.

Bennie Starks’ jacket was recovered from the crime scene, the victim
identified Starks in a photo lineup and bite marks found on the victim matched
Starks’ teeth.

Starks served 20 years of the 60-year prison sentence he received after his
1986 conviction. But DNA testing from sperm recovered after the trial ruled
out Starks as the rapist, said Vanessa Potkin, staff attorney with New York-
based Innocence Project.

“This is a huge day,” Potkin said after three sexual assault charges against
Starks were dismissed Tuesday in Lake County Court. “It’s really been a long
time coming.”

Potkin called the bite mark evidence “junk science” that is “notoriously
unreliable.” She said she believed police suggested the victim pick Starks’
photo in the lineup.

Potkin also said that Starks had been robbed of his coat and other items the
same day as the attack yet police built a case against him anyway.

Starks was granted a new trial in 2006 and released from custody because the
state appellate court ruled defense attorneys were not allowed to properly
cross-examine the alleged victim, who is now dead.

Starks said Tuesday after court that he always was “definitely confident” he
would emerge victorious.

“I just kept the faith. I never wavered in my belief in my attorneys and my
spiritual leader, God. It’s been a long battle,” Starks said.

Starks said he now plans to spend time with his family and grandchildren “just
living,” he said, and commended the Innocence Project for their work since
they took him on as a client in 1996.

Starks is not quite completely exonerated from the 1985 crime. A legal
technicality severed the sexual assault charges from an aggravated battery
charge, Potkin said. The appellate court has yet to rule whether Starks has
the right to challenge the aggravated battery charge.

“We’re very hopeful the appellate court will put this case to rest,” Potkin
said.

12:01 a.m. CDT  ,  May 17, 2012

Relatives of the bride found dead in a Burbank bath tub said they know very
little about the woman's new husband, who is wanted by police and charged with
her murder.

  
Arnoldo Jimenez of Chicago's [ Brighton Park ][1] neighborhood allegedly
stabbed to death Estrella Carrera as she still wore the sparkly silver dress
she had worn to celebrate their nuptials, police said.

  
Carrera's family said they rarely saw Jimenez at family functions. They don't
know how he was able to afford his black Maserati, and both family and police
said they don't know what Jimenez did for a living.

  
""He had all that and no history of working,"" said Carrera's older sister,
Jazmin Carrera.Police also are looking into Jimenez's background.

  
""He doesn't have a job that we know of,"" Burbank police Capt. Joe Ford said
Wednesday.

  
On Friday the couple had married and then celebrated into the wee hours of
Saturday morning with friends and family at a [ Little Village ][2]
restaurant, a party limo and a night club, police and family said. Jazmin
Carrera did not attend the spur-of-the-moment celebration.

  
Estrella Carrera, 26, was found stabbed to death in a bathtub in her Burbank
apartment Sunday.

  
On Tuesday, an arrest warrant was issued for Jimenez, 30, of the 4200 block of
South Mozart Street in Chicago. He is charged with first-degree murder.

  
On Wednesday, a [ FBI ][3] spokeswoman said the agency was pursuing a federal
warrant, usually indicating that authorities have evidence that the suspect
has fled the state.

  
Jazmin Carrera and other relatives said they did not approve of the couple's
relationship, which had been tumultuous for about three years.

  
""He was so possessive with her and jealous,"" Jazmin Carrera said.

  
Jazmin Carrera said she saw bruises and signs of physical abuse on her sister.
When confronted, Estrella Carrera did not deny the abuse, Jazmin said.

  
Court records show Jimenez was charged in 2003 with domestic battery, but the
complaining witness did not show up to court and the charges were dropped.

  
Jimenez is the father of Carrera's youngest child, a 2-year-old boy. Carrera
was also mother to a 9-year-old daughter, relatives said.Jimenez should ""do
the right thing and turn himself in and face everything that he did,"" Jazmin
Carrera said.

  
A wake for Carrera will be held Friday from 3 p.m. to 9 p.m. at Foran Funeral
Home, 7300 W. Archer Avenue, Summit. A funeral mass will be held Saturday at
St. Rita Church, 6243 S. Fairfield Avenue, Chicago.

May 27, 2012

It was shortly before 2 a.m. on the eve of the [ NATO summit ][7] when the
young criminal-defense lawyer emerged from a West Side police station where
three purported anarchists had just been charged with making four Molotov
cocktails to firebomb political targets.

Prosecutors would not outline their terrorism case until hours later in a
traditional news conference. But outside that darkened station, Sarah
Gelsomino, an attorney with the National Lawyers Guild, stepped in front of
the bright TV lights, pulled out a yellow legal pad and immediately began
attacking the state's case as a trumped-up, politically motivated intimidation
campaign by the city.

""Charging these people who are here to peacefully protest against [ NATO ][8]
for terrorism when in reality the police have been terrorizing activists in
Chicago is absolutely outrageous,"" Gelsomino said as demonstrators held up
smartphones and streamed the statement live to YouTube.

With that, Gelsomino, who turned 30 last month, solidified her position as the
public face of an aggressive effort to undercut the terrorism case against the
out-of-town men known to supporters as the NATO 3. Two others were also
charged with explosives-related offenses stemming from the same investigation.

In the ensuing days, Gelsomino and her partners at the National Lawyers Guild
took the extraordinary step of calling on activists to try to publicly
identify two individuals believed to be police informants or undercover
officers -- known on the street as ""Mo"" and ""Gloves"" -- who infiltrated the
group and led to the arrests.

The Guild also emailed a news release with a photo of ""Mo"" even while
acknowledging that he was possibly a Chicago police officer working
undercover. Gelsomino was one of two contacts on the release.

In her efforts, some legal analysts said, Gelsomino walked a fine line between
advocating passionately for a client and unethical behavior that could
endanger undercover police or law enforcement informants. Experts called it a
highly unusual if not unprecedented way to begin defending a case.

Retired Cook County Criminal Court Judge David Erickson, who now teaches at
Chicago-Kent College of Law, said criticism of the prosecution case -- from
calling wiretaps illegal to decrying the use of undercover cops or informants
-- is fair game. But he said identifying those inside an investigation is
dangerous and not necessary so early in the case.

""It is not something I would teach a young lawyer to do,"" said Erickson, also
a former top county prosecutor. ""I would expect more out of members of the
bar. My job is to defend my client. My job is not to put somebody else's life
at risk.""

Gelsomino was not available for comment on the strategy on Friday, but Michael
Deutsch, her co-counsel, said they have every right to thoroughly investigate
the charges against their clients and determine the identities of informants
and their interactions with the protest group.

""Our view is that these guys have been acting as provocateurs not only in this
case, but other cases,"" Deutsch said. ""Just because they are police or working
with police doesn't give them a pass. I don't think it's unethical or
improper. It would be improper for us as defense attorneys not to
investigate.""

It has been a rapid rise to recognition for Gelsomino, a 2008 graduate of [
DePaul University ][9] College of Law who worked as a law clerk in the Cook
County public defender's office before joining the high-profile People's Law
Office later that year.

She burst onto the scene in late 2011 as the strident defender of Occupy
Chicago activists as that movement gained traction across the country. Earlier
this year, Gelsomino helped defend about 90 Occupy members who challenged
their arrest for refusing to leave Grant Park.

Veteran attorney G. Flint Taylor Jr., who helped bring Gelsomino to the
People's Law Office, said her intelligence and passion for progressive issues
made her a natural fit for a firm long known for taking on police torture,
racial discrimination and other civil rights cases.

""Sarah has a history of commitment to social justice that began long before
she went to law school,"" Taylor said. ""We instantly saw her as a young lawyer
who could fit into our firm in terms of what we believed in and how we fought
for social justice.""

Raised in suburban Cleveland, Gelsomino had a progressive Catholic upbringing,
attending an all-girl's Catholic high school, where she became involved with
many social causes. After graduating from high school, she went to Latin
America to join the populist movement to close theU.S. ArmySchool of the
Americas, which activists said trained hit squads.

Since coming to Chicago, she has helped reinvigorate the local chapter of the
National Lawyers Guild, where she sits on the board, writes the monthly
newsletter and formed Next Gen, a group of young lawyers and law students
""dedicated to social change,"" according to the group's website.

At the People's Law Office, Gelsomino played a key role in winning a $6.2
million settlement with the city of Chicago in a class-action suit over the
2003 mass arrests of anti- [ Iraq War ][10] marchers, according to Taylor. She
has also contributed on high-profile police torture cases involving disgraced
former Chicago police Cmdr. [ Jon Burge ][11] .

""We tend to get broken in on hard cases, important cases where you have to
have courage and backbone,"" Taylor said. ""Sarah has shown that from the get-
go.""

Married in 2009, Gelsomino is also a yoga instructor and has a 1-year-old
child. She took a leave of absence when her son was born but is back full time
now, Taylor said.

By William Lee  Tribune reporter

9:11 a.m. CDT  ,  May 28, 2012

A 35-year-old man was fatally shot and at least eight others were injured in
separate overnight shootings across the city.

The shootings, which occurred between late Sunday and this morning, continued
a [ streak of shootings ][2] that occurred during the warm [ Memorial Day ][3]
weekend. So far this year, the city has had more homicides and shooting
incidents than during the same period last year, according to the most recent
citywide crime statistics.

In the fatal shooting, the victim was struck in the chest at about 1:20 a.m.
Monday in an alley in the 5000 block of South St. Lawrence Avenue in the
Bronzeville neighborhood, police said.

The victim, Robert McNear, of the 7100 block of South Eberhart Avenue, was
later pronounced dead, according to the Cook County medical examiner's office.

Authorities had few details, but police recovered multiple .45-caliber shell
casings at the scene in a shooting they said appeared gang-related.

A 25-year-old man was shot in the head at about 2:30 a.m. in the 1700 block of
East 54th Street in the East [ Hyde Park ][4] neighborhood, police said. The
man was taken to [ Northwestern Memorial Hospital ][5] in serious condition.

Early reports indicated the shooting may have occurred among a large group of
revelers all congregated in the area, police said.

About 20 minutes later, a young couple was shot inside a car in the 600 block
of West 124th Street in the West Pullman neighborhood, police said. The 25
-year-old woman and 26-year-old man were sitting in an auto when a man in a
dark hooded sweatshirt began quarreling with the man before  pulling out a
handgun, police said.

The couple's vehicle drove off, but both victims were wounded in the chest.
They drove themselves to MetroSouth Medical Center in Blue Island, where the
woman was listed in critical condition and the man in ""stable"" condition.

Earlier in the evening, a 24-year-old man was shot in the cheek just before
1:30 a.m. in the 4700 block of North Central Park Avenue, in the Albany Park
neighborhood. He was taken to Advocate Illinois Masonic Medical Center in
stable condition.

At about 1:10 a.m., a woman in her 30s was wounded in the 7800 block of South
Sangamon Street in the Gresham neighborhood. She was taken to Advocate Christ
Medical Center in Oak Lawn in an unknown condition.

A 23-year-old man said he was crossing the street in the 7500 block of South
Colfax Avenue in the South Shore neighborhood at about 12:43 a.m. when he
heard a gunshot and felt pain in his back, police said. His cousin took him to
[ Jackson Park ][6] Hospital and Medical Center for treatment.

Earlier in the night, a 19-year-old man was wounded in the torso at 9 p.m.
Sunday in the 4200 block of South State Street in The Robert Taylor Homes
neighborhood. The man was initially taken toJohn H. Stroger, Jr. Hospital of
Cook Countyin critical condition, but police expect him to survive.

Also on late Sunday night, a woman suffered a graze wound to her head at about
11 p.m. in the 1100 block of East 43rd Street in the [ Oakland ][7]
neighborhood, police said.

The 33-year-old victim was taken to the [ University of Chicago ][8] Medical
Center in good condition, police said.

There were two groups involved in a verbal altercation as they crossed a
bridge leading from the lake front over Lake Shore Drive, police said. People
from both groups pulled out handguns and began shooting, police said. The
woman who was also walking over the bridge at the time was caught in
crossfire. Her friends took her to the hospital where she was interviewed by
police.

Cook County prosecutors have dropped the case against a man who has spent the
last 25 years in prison.

James Kluppelberg, 46, was convicted of setting fire in 1984 that killed a
woman and her five kids in their Back of the Yards home.

Kluppelberg has maintained his innocence from the beginning and after attempts
to challenge Kluppelberg's appeal, Cook County prosecutors told a judge
Wednesday they wanted to dismiss the charges.

News of Kluppelberg's release did not reach him until his lawyer called with
the surprising news. The Chicago Tribune reports his lawyer said Kluppelberg
was ""blown away.""

The fire originally was ruled accidental by the Police Department's Bomb and
Arson Unit, but firefighters changed the cause of the fire to arson.

After an investigation, police arrested and charged Kluppelberg, who police
said confessed to the crime after being linked to other fires. His confession
was inadmissible in court because of alleged police coercion.

Evidence in a recent reinvestigation of the arson prompted the decision to
drop the case.

[ Kluppelberg was released from prison Thursday afternoon ][5] .

Police say a man didn’t think it was as funny as his son’s mother when she
sent him a picture of the 1-year-old boy bound and gagged with tape in
southwest suburban Joliet.

Megan A. Reed, 23, told investigators the incident occurred in September when
she was watching over several children who were playing with tape, Chief Mike
Trafton said.

“She admitted taking a photo with her phone and sent it in February to the
boy’s father,” Trafton said. Two months later, the man came to police and said
he’d had trouble opening messages on his new phone, but had finally gotten it
to work.

According to reports, the image shows the boy’s mouth is covered and his hands
are bound with the clear tape.

A warrant was issued for Reed’s arrest, but she was reportedly out of the
state until June when she came into the police station with a lawyer. She
allegedly said the kids were having fun and her cousin taped the infant and
the tape was removed after the photo.

On Monday, Reed, of 450 Nobes Ave. in Lockport, was arrested and booked into
the county jail on charges of unlawful restraint and endangering the life or
health of a child.

e disability rules, after some apparently major abuses have been uncovered.

As WBBM Newsradio Political Editor Craig Dellimore reports, a Chicago Sun-
Times investigation shows the City of Chicago spent $18 million in a year for
police disability leave, though few officers ever go back to the department,
and many have moved on to other, more comfortable careers.

Mayor Emanuel was asked if reforms are needed.

“The short answer? Absolutely,” he said.

The reason, he says, is that many officers clearly deserve the benefits.

“They do very serious work, and it’s there to protect them, and everybody
knows there are a few bad actors who are ruining it for everybody else,” he
said.

For that reason, the mayor is asking his financial team to outline changes.

“It is there as an insurance policy of protection,” Emanuel said. “It is not
there for a few bad actors to abuse and then take down the system as a whole.”

The mayor spoke at an unrelated North Side event.

**CHICAGO (CBS)** -- Police are investigating multiple reports of a smell of nat
ural gas in and around the Lincoln Park neighborhood.

The natural gas odor has been detected in the 1900 block of North Clybourn
Avenue – near the junction with Racine Avenue and Cortland Street, as well as
in the 1000 block of West Armitage Avenue – just west of Sheffield Avenue and
the busy Armitage Brown-Purple Line ‘L’ stop.

A school in the 1100 block of West Armitage Avenue had to be evacuated because
of the gas odor. The Goddard School, a preschool program, is located at 1124
W. Armitage Ave.

The gas smell was also detected several blocks farther east, in the 500 block
of West Belden Avenue between Geneva Terrace and Cleveland Avenue.

In all, there were seven locations where the gas smell was found.

Fire Department crews are investigating to determine the source.

s plan to cut gang violence and homicides could cost the city up to $14 million 
in overtime this summer. 

As WBBM Newsradio's David Roe reports, the money is already accounted for in
the department's budget. [Emanuel told the Chicago Tribune][1] that offering
overtime work to officers on their days off is a familiar strategy that's been
used in other years.

But this time, he tells the newspaper, the overtime strategy being directed in
a more targeted way in the face of a nearly 38 percent increase in the murder
rate for the first six months of this year.

The mayor tells the Tribune that this time, the strategy is being used on a
more extensive basis and, he says, the city is beginning to see results.

Mayor Emanuel and police Supt. Garry McCarthy announced plans to use the
strategy last month.

Officers are able to work extra and longer shifts Thursday through Monday, and
work on their days off. They report to the police facility at 6120 S. Racine
Ave. in the Englewood neighborhood, and are assigned to different areas of the
city as needed.

A police spokeswoman said last month the overtime will be paid through the
entire summer, and the initiative is likely to hit the city's budget hard.

BY LYNN SWEET Washington Bureau Chief  July 20, 2012 4:52PM

  *   *   *   * WASHINGTON — President Barack Obama and GOP rival Mitt Romney cu
rtailed campaigning on Friday in the wake of the shooting massacre in Aurora, Co
lo. at a theater premiering “The Dark Knight Rises.” 

“There are going to be other days for politics. This, I think, is a day for
prayer and reflection,” Obama said.

Both men dropped partisan rhetoric in addressing the tragedy, and each spoke
as a parent — Obama from Fort Myers, Fla., and Romney from Bow, New Hampshire.
“What if Malia or Sasha had been at that theater,” Obama said.

“I stand before you today not as a man running for office but as a father and
grandfather, a husband, an American,” Romney said.

The president ordered flags at the White House and all federal buildings and
military posts in the U.S. and abroad to be flown at half-staff through sunset
on July 25 as a “mark of respect for the victims of the senseless acts of
violence.”

Obama cut short his Florida swing to return from Fort Myers to Washington,
where he was to meet with Vice President Joe Biden, FBI Director Robert
Mueller, Chief of Staff Jack Lew, Homeland Security Advisor John Brennan,
White House counsel Kathy Ruemmler and Senior Advisor Valerie Jarrett.

Brennan told Obama about the shootings at 4:26 a.m. CDT, White House Press
Secretary Jay Carney said, hours after the shooter entered the theater at 1:30
a.m. CDT.

Earlier on Friday, the White House said Obama spoke with the mayor of Aurora,
Steve Hogan, and Colorado Governor John Hickenlooper.

Both campaigns pulled their ads from television outlets in Colorado, a key
election state. At first Obama campaign spokesman Jen Psaki said “contrasting”
spots against Romney would be yanked. Later the campaign said in a statement
all spots would be cancelled for the time being.

First Lady Michelle Obama, Ann Romney and Biden cancelled their campaign
stops.

Romney and Obama each spoke about the Colorado tragedy at subdued events
stripped of overt campaign signage.

Obama, speaking Friday morning, said, “We may never understand what leads
anybody to terrorize their fellow human beings like this. Such violence, such
evil is senseless. It’s beyond reason. But while we will never know fully what
causes somebody to take the life of another, we do know what makes life worth
living. The people we lost in Aurora loved and they were loved.

“They were mothers and fathers, they were husbands and wives, sisters and
brothers, sons and daughters, friends and neighbors. They had hopes for the
future and they had dreams that were not yet fulfilled.

“And if there’s anything to take away from this tragedy, it’s the reminder
that life is very fragile. Our time here is limited and it is precious.

“And what matters at the end of the day is not the small things; it’s not the
trivial things, which so often consume us and our daily lives. Ultimately,
it’s how we choose to treat one another and how we love one another.

“...I’m sure that many of you who are parents here had the same reaction that
I did when I heard this news. You know, my daughters go to the movies. What if
Malia and Sasha had been at the theater, as so many of our kids do every day?
Michelle and I will be fortunate enough to hug our girls a little tighter
tonight, and I’m sure you will do the same with your children. But for those
parents who may not be so lucky, we have to embrace them and let them know we
will be there for them as a nation,” Obama said.

On Friday afternoon, in Bow, Romney said, “Our hearts break with the sadness
of this unspeakable tragedy. Ann and I join the president and first lady and
all Americans in offering our deepest condolences for those whose lives were
shattered in a few moments — a few moments of evil — in Colorado.

“I stand before you today not as a man running for office but as a father and
grandfather, a husband, an American. This is a time for each of us to look
into our hearts and remember how much we love one another and how much we love
and how much we care for our great country. There’s so much love and goodness
in the heart of America.

“In the coming days we’ll surely learn more about the lives that have been
lost and the families that have been harmed by this hateful act. We’ll come to
know more about the talents and the gifts that each victim possessed, and
we’ll come to understand the hope and the opportunity that’s been lost.

“Our hearts break for the victims and their families. We pray that the wounded
will recover and that those who are grieving will know the nearness of God.

“Today we feel not only a sense of grief, but perhaps also of helplessness.
But there is something we can do. We can offer comfort to someone near us who
is suffering or heavy-laden. And we can mourn with those who mourn in
Colorado,” Romney said.

A 23-year-old South Side man was ordered held without bond Wednesday for
allegedly murdering a man and wounding his uncle outside a Marquette Park
Walgreens earlier this summer.

Demonte Williams indicated to another person that he wanted to do a “lick” or
robbery before he pulled the trigger on the night of June 4, assistant Cook
County State’s Attorney Craig Engebretson said.

Willie Stallworth had stepped outside the car after he and his uncle pulled up
to a Walgreens, at 7111 S. Western, when Williams jumped into the vehicle and
pointed the gun at the older man, authorities said.

The two men struggled over the weapon before Williams shot the 54-year-old man
in the chest, Engebretson said.

Stallworth, 30, who had been making a phone call, was shot in the chest when
he confronted Williams outside, Engebretson said.

Before the shooting, Williams allegedly asked someone for a gun so he could
commit a robbery.

That person refused but walked with Williams to another house where he went in
and returned with a weapon, which the witness saw as they made their way to
the Walgreens, Engebretson said.

The witness left Williams as he made his way to the drugstore and saw him
running from the lot following the gunshots, Engebretson said.

The witness then ran to the parking lot and stayed with the victims until
police arrived.

Williams, who has a five-point star tattoo on his neck, was later identified
by the witness and Stallworth’s uncle, who still has a bullet lodged in his
chest, prosecutors said.

Williams, of the 7600 block of South Hamilton, was sentenced to four years in
prison in 2009 for an aggravated unlawful restraint conviction.

He also has a 2009 misdemeanor resisting conviction and was found delinquent
as a juvenile for robbery in 2004.

August 30, 2012 (JOLIET, Ill.) (WLS) --  Prosecutors in the Christopher Vaughn
murder trial zeroed in on a key piece of evidence Thursday.

Prosecutors questioned a forensic scientist with the Illinois State Police
Department about the jacket Vaughn was wearing the day his wife and three
children were shot.

Nicole Fundell testified the garment had bullet holes consistent with someone
wrapping it around a gun and firing.

An AK-47-style weapon seized near Des Plaines.  (  Cook County Sheriff's
police  /  September  1  , 2012  )

By Dawn Rhodes  Tribune reporter

9:38 p.m. CDT  ,  September 1, 2012

A north suburban man faces felony and misdemeanor charges after Cook County
sheriff's officers found an unloaded AK-47-style weapon behind his home
following a dispute with his neighbor, officials said.

  
Timothy Bogacki, of the 4000 block of Touhy Avenue in unincorporated Cook
County near Des Plaines, was charged with being an armed habitual criminal,
which is a Class X felony, in addition to unlawful use of a weapon, reckless
conduct and battery, according to sheriff spokesman Frank Bilecki.

  
Sheriff's officers were called to a trailer park at that address just before 5
a.m. Saturday after a man reported that Bogacki punched him and threatened him
with some kind of rifle, according to Bilecki.

  
Seven additional officers were called to the scene and found Bogacki hiding in
the bushes about three blocks away, Bilecki said.

  
Bogacki consented to a search of his residence and officers recovered the
weapon from behind the home, while an ammunition magazine was found inside a
sock in the home, Bilecki said.

  
The semiautomatic weapon is registered to his wife, who is out of town on
military duty, Bilecki said.

  
Bogacki, 32, is a self-admitted member of the Latin Kings gang, Bilecki said.

  
Records show that he was convicted of burglary in 2000 and of aggravated
battery in 2001. He was sentenced to 3 1/2 years in the Illinois Department of
Corrections for the latter offense. Under Illinois statute, a person can be
charged with armed habitual criminal if they sell, receive, transfer or
possess a firearm after having been convicted of two or more forcible
felonies, among other offenses.

  
Bogacki is due to appear in bond court on Sunday.

September 4, 2012 (CHICAGO) (WLS) --  A jury ruled in favor of 21 Cook County
Sheriff's Department employees Tuesday who sued Sheriff Tom Dart and other
high ranking department officials for what they call political discrimination.

The employees were awarded more than $1.5 million. All were part of the
department's elite special operation response team.

The suit claimed response team was disbanded two weeks after the 2006 primary
election because they supported Tom Dart's opponent in the race.

""They were harmed, not only by the disbanding of their team, but denied
promotion, retaliated against, harassed, disciplined, one disciplined despite
a court order for attending the trial,"" said plantiffs' attorney Dana Kurtz.

Dart issued a statement, saying, ""This case has never been about retaliation
for violating someone's rights; this decision has always been about holding
employees accountable for their actions and doing what is right ... that is
why we feel very confident in appealing this decision.""

A Cook County judge Tuesday found a Lake View woman accused of suffocating her
eight-month-old son while battling a severe postpartum condition not guilty by
reason of insanity.

Janet Thies-Keogh is a “very, very sick” woman, Judge James Linn said, adding
that Colin Keogh died because of his mother’s deteriorating mental health.

After Linn cleared Thies-Keogh, 32, of murder, she hugged several relatives,
including her husband who called 911 after she told him over the phone that
“it’s too late” on the night of Feb. 7, 2011.

During the nearly three-hour bench trial, assistant state’s attorney Christa
Bowden argued that Thies-Keogh planned to kill the baby and had been waiting
for the moment to act when her husband stepped out for a quick jaunt to the
gym.

But even the prosecution’s witness Chicago Police Sgt. Matt Kennedy sensed
that Thies-Keogh was not well when he arrived at the couple’s apartment, in
the 3900 block of North Ashland.

Thies-Keogh had a “grayish” tone to her face when Kennedy said she let him
into her unit and he saw the lifeless baby at the foot of the bed in the
master bedroom.

“She was staring off in to space,” Kennedy testified.

Thies-Keogh, who has been receiving psychiatric care and taking medication
while out on bond, was most likely psychotic when Colin was harmed, mental
health professionals testified.

Thies-Keogh’s attorney Thomas Brandstrader said she was “detached from
reality” at the time and “does not even remember” what she did to Colin.

Linn commended Thies-Keogh’s “extremely conscientious” husband for going to
authorities as soon as he heard the baby was in danger and said he shouldn’t
shoulder blame for briefly leaving Colin in his ill wife’s care.

Linn ordered Thies-Keogh to undergo an evaluation by the Illinois Department
of Human Services.

For the second time in three hours, police shot and wounded a suspect, making
it the fifth police-involved shooting in a week.

The latest shooting happened about 12:05 a.m. in the 7900 block of South South
Shore Drive, police News Affairs Officer Hector Alfaro said, citing
preliminary information.

He confirmed a suspect was wounded, but could not immediately release
additional details.

About 9:26 p.m. Sunday, a robbery suspect was shot and seriously wounded by
police in the 5400 block of West Bloomingdale Avenue, according to a statement
from police News Affairs.

Grand Central District officers were responding to a call of a robbery in
progress when they saw a male who matched the description of the robbery
suspect, the statement said. The officers tried to question him, but the
suspect refused to the stop.

The suspect then threatened to attack the officers and “moved toward his
waistband and produced an object,” according to the statement. So officers
fired shots and struck him.

Paramedics took one person in serious condition to Loyola University Medical
Center in Maywood, Fire Media Affairs said.

The statement made no mention of a weapon being recovered.

These two shootings are the latest in a series of police-involved shootings
since last Tuesday.

On Friday at 1:45 a.m., Gresham District Police officers saw a van traveling
with its passenger door open in the 600 block of East 75th Street, according
to a statement from police News Affairs. The officers began following the van
and a suspect exited the vehicle with a gun in his hand that he pointed at
officers.

The officers stated their position and a foot and vehicle pursuit began as the
suspect fled northbound on foot, the statement said. The officers were then
confronted by the suspect in an alley on 75th Street between Michigan and
Wabash avenues.

The suspect pointed the gun at the officers who then shot him, the statement
said. The suspect was arrested and hospitalized.

No police officers were injured and a weapon was recovered, the statement
said.

The suspect, indentified as 20-year-old Jovan Killingsworth of the 6400 block
of South May Street, was charged with four counts of aggravated assault with a
firearm to a police officer and one count of unlawful use of a weapon, police
said. He was ordered held on $500,000 bond.

Two suspects were also shot within three hours early last Tuesday.

Grand Crossing District officers responded at 3:15 a.m. to a call of a
suspicious person wearing a ski mask in the 7400 block of South State Street,
according to a statement from police.

Upon arriving at the scene, tactical officers saw the masked male committing a
robbery with a gun, the statement said. The officers exited their vehicle,
announced who they were and ordered the suspect to drop his weapon. He fired
at the officers, who returned fire and the suspect fled on foot.

After a brief foot chase, a responding marked police vehicle intercepted the
suspect at the corner of 74th and State streets, the statement said. The
suspect fired at the officers, who returned fire and he fled through rear
yards in the 7400 block of South Wabash Avenue, where gunfire was exchanged.

The suspect was found hiding on the front porch of a home in the 7400 block of
South Wabash and resisted arrest, the statement said. He was arrested after
being Tasered and was hospitalized with several gunshot wounds.

No police officers were injured, the statement said.

A weapon, ski mask, and hooded sweatshirt were recovered at the scene.

Earlier that same night, police shot and wounded a 17-year-old.

About 12:30 a.m., officers from the Area South Gun Team were on patrol in the
8900 block of South Union Avenue when they attempted to stop a curfew
violator, a police statement said.

As the officers approached, the teen fled on foot. Officers gave chase through
several yards and eventually to an alley, where teen pointed a weapon in the
direction of an officer. An exchange of gunfire ensued, resulting in Jackson
being struck, according to police.

He was taken to Advocate Christ Medical Center in Oak Lawn with several
gunshot wounds, Fraternal Order of Police spokesman Pat Camden said.

A weapon was recovered, police said. No officers were injured.

A Cook County prosecutor was injured when two men attacked him for trying to
stop an assault on two apparently gay men in Lincoln Park.

The attack happened about 7 p.m. Thursday in the 200 block of West Diversey
Parkway, police said.

The 32-year-old employee of the Cook County State’s Attorney’s office was
walking by himself along the lakefront when he saw two men approach two
apparently gay men and verbally assault them, state’s attorney’s office
spokeswoman Sally Daly said.

The prosecutor yelled at the men to stop, Daly said. The attackers then
physically attacked him.

They slashed or stabbed the prosecutor multiple times, including cutting his
face, right side and arms, Daly said.

Police said the victim was taken to Advocate Illinois Masonic Medical Center
with “non-life-threatening injuries.” He remained there Friday afternoon.
State’s Attorney Anita Alvarez visited him at the hospital, Daly said.

“He did lose a lot of blood,” Daly said. “He is in pain but thankfully is
going to be OK.”

The prosecutor has been an assistant state’s attorney since 2008 and currently
works in the juvenile justice bureau, Daly said.

Tip leads to arrest of 83-year-old in hit-and-run death

A tip from an auto body shop helped police locate and charge an 83-year-old
woman with a hit-and-run crash that killed a 6-year-old boy in McHenry County
last weekend.

Witnesses told police the boy was struck just after 9 p.m. Saturday by a
vehicle that left the scene without stopping near 4601 Franklinville Rd. in
Seneca Township, between Woodstock and Marengo.

The boy was taken to Centegra Hospital in Woodstock where he was pronounced
dead.

Following a tip from a body shop, the sheriff’s Traffic Crash Investigation
Unit determined a silver 2001 Chevrolet Malibu, driven by Veramae C. Phillip,
83, of Woodstock, struck the boy in the roadway, a release from the sheriff’s
office said.

After warrants were authorized, charging felony counts of leaving the scene of
a fatal traffic crash and failure to report a fatal traffic crash, Phillip
turned herself in on Thursday, according to the sheriff’s office. She was
released after paying $5,000 bail on a $50,000 bond, the release said.

‘Wonder dog’ finds $300,000 worth of opium at mail facility near O’Hare

Chalk up another drug bust for Rogue the “wonder dog.”

The federal drug-detecting pooch is being credited with helping federal agents
seize a shipment of opium-saturated decorative cloth valued at more than
$300,000 from an international mail processing center near O’Hare.

U.S. Customs and Border Protection agents working at the CBP International
Mail Facility recently seized two shipments of the decorative narcotics-laden
materials that had been shipped from Laos.

The drug-sniffing dog alerted agents to the parcels, which contained more than
28 pounds of the drug-soaked cloth, which was valued at $302,000, a release
from CBP said.

After Rogue alerted agents, they opened the two packages which contained
pieces of decorative cloth and hats. But a field narcotics test revealed the
presence of opium in the fabric of the cloth, which emitted a strong odor, the
release said.

The parcels contained more than 28 pounds of opium-saturated cloth and hats.
They were manifested as “Hmong Dresses” and addressed to individuals in
different Minnesota cities, the release said.

Rogue, a 5-year-old Belgian malinois, belongs to the CBP Port of Chicago
canine family, which works at international mail facilities to examine foreign
shipments coming into the United States.

“CBP narcotic seizures from international mail are on the rise in Chicago,”
Steven Artino, acting CBP Director in Chicago, said in a statement. “Rogue is
a wonder dog in the international mail environment. He transferred from our
CBP Cincinnati express consignment operation last April and has now found more
than 600 shipments of opium here in Chicago, valued at more than $4 million.”

Indiana man killed in wrong-way crash

A northwest Indiana man was killed in a wrong-way crash on the Borman
Expressway in Gary, Ind., early Friday.

The man — identified as of 35-year-old Timothy J. Leib of Hobart, Ind. — was
driving a Honda Ridgeline pickup west in the eastbound lanes when he collided
with a semi truck near the Broadway Exit at 1:30 a.m., according to a release
from Indiana State police. Police do not know where Leib got on the freeway.

The semi driver was eastbound when another semi in front of him swerved
suddenly, the release said. The semi then collided head-on with Leib’s pickup.

Leib was pronounced dead at the scene, according to the release.

Police believe alcohol may have been a factor in the crash. All lanes of
traffic were reopened by 4:30 a.m.

By William Lee  Tribune reporter

7:23 a.m. CDT  ,  September 17, 2012

A man sentenced to 40 years in prison for killing a man during a home invasion
in 1998 died of blood poisoning and the so-called flesh-eating bacteria, an
autopsy has found.

Robert J. Turner, 32, died Friday at the [ University of Illinois Medical
Center at Chicago ][2] 's intensive care unit after he was transferred there
last Wednesday, according to the Cook County medical examiner's office.

Turner was on a medical furlough from the Dixon Correctional Center and was
being treated for a number of maladies, including [ cirrhosis of the liver
][3] , authorities said.

An autopsy performed Sunday determined that Turner died of [ necrotizing
fasciitis ][4] -- more commonly called the flesh-eating bacteria -- and [
sepsis ][5] and his death was ruled natural, according to the medical
examiner's office.

The flesh-eating disorder is a rare but severe type of infection that can
destroy the muscles, skin and other underlying tissue.

Turner was 18 when he and two other men were charged with the shooting death
of Derek Miles, 18.

Chicago police said Turner and the other men confronted Miles and two
companions on the street and demanded money. After Miles and his companions
could come up with only $15,  one of victims offered to hand over valuables
stored in Miles' home.

The victims and robbers went to the home in the 6200 block of South Albany
Avenue, police said. While the three suspects collected stereo equipment and
other items, Miles slipped away and got a gun from another part of the house.

When Miles returned and confronted the three men, police said someone fired
several shots and killed Miles.

Officials from the Illinois Department of Corrections weren't immediately
available for comment this morning.

Rising rap star Chief Keef belongs behind bars for his own safety, Cook County
prosecutors said in juvenile court Wednesday.

The Chicago singer, whose real name is Keith Cozart, faces possible
retribution for the fatal shooting last month of up-and-coming rapper Joseph
“Lil JoJo” Coleman, Cook County prosecutors said.

Chief Keef isn’t implicated in the Sept. 4 slaying of JoJo, 18, but police are
investigating whether the killing was linked to a war of words between the
two.

On Wednesday, prosecutors asked Judge Carl Anthony Walker to put Chief Keef in
juvenile detention for two alleged violations of probation he received in an
unrelated gun case. The judge said he won’t lock up Chief Keef, 17, before he
holds a hearing Nov. 20 but he added: “I really believe this minor should be
placed on electronic home monitoring.”

Chicago Police officials said they wanted Chief Keef placed in juvenile
detention to protect himself and others — and to send a message that everyone,
including celebrities, must follow the law.

“Anytime he is in Chicago, he is a potential target and anyone around him is
in jeopardy, including innocent kids,” said Nicholas Roti, chief of the
Chicago Police Department’s Organized Crime Bureau.

“This is an example of people who are associated with violence in Chicago who
aren’t held accountable for their actions,” Roti said.

Chief Keef planned to return to California on Wednesday, said his attorney,
Dennis Berkson. He has been living on the West Coast since JoJo was killed.

Chief Keef, who’s on the same record label as rap superstar 50 Cent, is
working in the studio and touring, Berkson said.

Last month, the judge approved Chief Keef’s move to Los Angeles in an effort
to protect him from violence here. Berkson emphasized that his client is safe
in California and doesn’t deserve to be locked up in Chicago.

“He has been a model young man,” said Berkson, adding that Chief Keef had
nothing to do with JoJo’s “unfortunate demise.”

As he left court Wednesday, Chief Keef raised his hands in a show of victory.
Earlier, he had predicted he would be released, saying to a reporter, “It’s a
piece of cake.”

Late Wednesday, defiant messages were posted on Chief Keef’s Twitter account.

“Prosecutors want me back in jail?! I aint going!!!! ... IM out here tryin to
get this money & they wanna stop me from shining!!!”

During a break in the hearing, Chief Keef lingered in a courthouse hallway,
singing snippets of his raps. One young girl, awaiting her own court hearing
nearby, heard him singing, then posed with Chief Keef and her mother for a
quick iPhone photo.

At one point Wednesday, he was chided by his probation officer for signing
court papers “Chief Keef” instead of his real name.

He wore baggy fatigues, a white T-shirt, an oversize gold watch, new Michael
Jordan gym shoes and a blue down vest to his hearing. As he waited for his
case, one woman scolded him, saying, “Young man in the blue jacket, pull your
pants up!”

He is serving 18 months of probation for pointing a gun at a Chicago cop. He
was also found delinquent on two other felonies.

Prosecutors argued he violated the probation by holding a rifle in an online
Pitchfork video.

Prosecutors pointed to the recorded promotional interview the rapper did in
June at a gun range in New York, where he can be seen with a rifle. That’s a
violation, prosecutors said, because his probation bans him from having any
guns or illegal drugs or associating with gang members.

Chief Keef also didn’t get his GED by the August deadline set in his probation
— another violation, prosecutors said.

Chief Keef’s attorney, Berkson, acknowledged the gun range video was “stupid”
but argued it was not his client’s fault because he was simply listening to
advice from adults.

Berkson also apologized for the delay on the GED. He said the rapper was
working on it and had switched tutors because he was living in California
recently while he was recording songs for Interscope Records.

Prosecutors cited other aggravating factors for the judge to consider.
Assistant Cook County State’s Attorney Jullian Brevard noted that on Sept. 30,
Chicago Police officers responded to a call of a gang disturbance in the 6300
block of South King Drive and found the rapper there associating with Black
Disciple gang members.

“I don’t know how he knows who is in a gang . . . and who is in the Boy
Scouts,” Berkson responded.

The rapper failed to provide a current phone number to his probation officer
and was out of touch for about two weeks, authorities added.

“He is still blowing off this court. He is still doing what he wants to do,”
Brevard said, noting that his “whole image is that he is a tough guy.”

“Everybody should be treated the same,” Brevard told the judge.

The concern for Chief Keef’s safety stems from a rap that JoJo posted,
disrespecting the Black Disciples street gang.

JoJo was a reputed member of the Gangster Disciples and Chief Keef has shown
an allegiance to the Black Disciples in his Twitter messages and music.

Members of Chief Keef’s entourage were feuding online with JoJo for months
before his slaying.

Hours after JoJo was killed in a drive-by shooting in Englewood, Chief Keef’s
Twitter account carried a message that included the hashtag #LMAO, mocking his
death. The acronym stands for “laughing my ass off.”

Later, Twitter messages from the same account denied that Chief Keef sent the
message, saying his account was hacked. Another said: “My prayers go out 2
Jojo’s family on their loss.”

While police have not tied Chief Keef to JoJo’s murder, they say it prompted
JoJo’s faction of Gangster Disciples in Englewood to lash out at the Black
Disciples on another side of the neighborhood. Detectives think at least one
other killing may have resulted from the feud since JoJo was killed, sources
said.

""Perversion Files"" were released Thursday, and they include the names of some
scout leaders here in Illinois.

The so-called Perversion Files have been kept at Boy Scout headquarters in
Texas for nearly a century. They include memos from local and national
officers, handwritten letters from victims, and legal information, all about
scout leaders' misconduct.

Thursday's release of two decades' worth of files is a window to what happened
inside one of America's greatest institutions, and the release includes dozens
of cases from Illinois.

[ Story:  Boy Scout files document alleged sex abuse ][1]

Fourteen thousand five hundred pages were released after the way was cleared
by the Oregon Supreme Court. They tell a sordid story of scouts being
molested, trusts violated and an organization going to extremes to cover it
up. At least 70 scout leaders from Illinois are named, most in metro Chicago.

The files released Thursday detail accusations, allegations, charges and
actions in the 1960's, 70's and 80's.

In a third of the cases, police were never even notified. Sometimes it was too
late.

Consider the case of a man found Thursday in the files by the ABC7 I-Team:
Gwenn ""Slinky"" Hale of Chicago.

According to the file, he was newly on parole when hired by the Boy Scouts
here. In 1982 records show he was convicted for armed violence, indecent
liberties and deviant sexual assault with a teenage boy and received a 16-year
sentence; 1993: convicted again, for aggravated criminal sexual assault with a
victim under the age of 13. This time, he received a 40-year sentence which he
is still serving.

The I-Team also found another man: Paul Scott Koefoot of Evanston. In 1983,
Koefoot's file shows that he molested a boy at a scout camp, but no charges
were filed. The boy's parents demanded he be let go, which he was. In 1984, he
was convicted of sexual assault; and in 1998, again, of sexual assault with a
child, all after moving to Nebraska.

The director of the Boy Scouts in Chicago Thursday night says things have
changed.

""Whatever happened in the past, we're sorry for, but we've gone a great deal
to make sure that every kid is safe when they participate in the scouting
program,"" said Charles Dobbins, CEO, Chicago Scout Council.

The national president of the Boy Scouts Thursday echoed that, saying that
there are cases where the organization failed to live up to standards, failed
to properly document cases, and fell short in other ways.

Three men have been killed and another 13 people wounded in gun violence
throughout Chicago since Friday afternoon.

The latest fatality happened early Sunday when a man was shot and killed while
walking with relatives in the West Side Austin neighborhood.

Denzell Williams, 21, of the 5600 block of West Washington Boulevard and his
relatives were walking down the sidewalk in the 0 to 100 block of North
Central Avenue about 3:05 a.m. when a male shooter walked up and pulled out a
handgun, authorities said. He was pronounced dead at the scene, according to
the Cook County Medical Examiner’s office.

He had been shot multiple times in the chest, police said. No one is in
custody early Sunday and a motive for the slaying was unclear.

Also early Sunday, a man was hurt in a drive-by shooting while sitting on a
porch in the Southwest Side Little Village neighborhood early Sunday.

The man, 21, was shot about 2:20 a.m. while sitting on the front porch in the
2800 block of South Harding Avenue, police News Affairs Officer Hector Alfaro
said.

A dark-colored SUV drove by and someone inside opened fire, leaving the man
shot in the upper left back, Alfaro said. He was taken in “stable” condition
to Mount Sinai Hospital.

And about 12:10 a.m. Sunday, a man was critically hurt in a drive-by shooting
in the South Side Back of the Yards neighborhood.

The man, 43, was walking in the 4900 block of South Justine when a light-
colored sedan drove by and someone inside started shooting, police News
Affairs Officer Hector Alfaro said.

He was taken to John H. Stroger Jr. Hospital of Cook County, where he is
listed in critical condition, Alfaro said.

On Saturday afternoon in the Garfield Park neighborhood, police found a 36
-year-old man dead with a gunshot wound to the head.

Claude Snulligan was discovered about 11:31 a.m. by police officers who were
responding to a call of a man down in the 0 to 100 block of South Pulaski
Road, authorities said.

Snulligan, of the 1600 block of South Drake Avenue, was pronounced dead at the
scene, according to the Cook County Medical Examiner’s office.

The circumstances surrounding the shooting were not immediately available.

The second fatality occurred Friday afternoon during an apparent robbery in
the South Deering neighborhood.

Terrance Wright, 18, was walking near the intersection of 99th Street and
Yates Avenue when he was shot in the chest about 3:40 p.m., authorities said.
Witnesses told police they saw about five people attempting to rob Wright
before he was shot, police said.

Wright, of the 5000 block of South Carpenter Street, was taken to Advocate
Christ Medical Center in Oak Lawn, where he was later pronounced dead, the
medical examiner’s office said.

A 15-year-old boy was among the 11 people wounded in shootings throughout the
city this weekend.

The teenager was walking through an alley in the 11400 block of South Stewart
when two males approached him about 7:30 p.m. on Friday, police said. One of
the males took out a handgun and shot the boy in the left side of his chest
and the right side of his body, police said, adding that the motive for the
shooting was not immediately known.

Paramedics took the boy in critical condition to Advocate Christ Medical
Center, according to Fire Media Affairs.

A 42-year-old man run down by a hit and run driver in Wicker Park last week
while he skateboarded to his car has died from his injuries.

Reginald “Reggie” Destin, had been hospitalized since the Oct. 19 crash in the
1700 block of North Milwaukee Avenue.

The Cook County Medical Examiner’s office said Saturday that Destin had died.

Friends say they saw the driver swerve into Destin, who had left a bar and was
heading to his car. Destin suffered multiple fractures, including a skull
fracture.

The driver kept going, but witnesses pointed him out and police officers
pulled him over as he turned west on North Avenue, authorities said.

Cook County prosecutors say the alleged driver, Luis P. Pena, 30, didn’t have
a driver’s license or insurance but got behind the wheel.

Pena smelled like alcohol and had bloodshot eyes after being puled over, but
he told police he “did not have that many beers,” prosecutors said. He also
allegedly refused a Breathalyzer. Tests later revealed he had a 0.188 blood-
alcohol level — more than twice the .08 legal limit, prosecutors said.

It wasn’t the first time Pena was arrested for a DUI. He was convicted of
aggravated DUI in 2007.

He was ordered held in lieu of $400,000 bail last week for the latest charges
of aggravated driving under the influence and leaving the scene of an accident
with life threatening injuries.

But, because of his other case, the judge ordered he be held without bond for
violating probation on another case.

When he was hit around 2 a.m. on Oct. 19, Destin was riding his skateboard for
a couple of blocks so he could get to his parked car after leaving a bar.

A friend was about 10 feet ahead of him, according to another friend,
professional skateboarder Johnny Fonseca. Destin’s companion saw Pena’s car
swerve into him once and almost hit him. And when he looked back a second
time, Destin was hit “dead on,” Fonseca said last week.

Destin was well known in the Chicago skating community and often frequented
the skateboard shop Uprise, which is a block from the accident. He had jobs
working for popular skateboard companies and owned a skateboarding shop called
Push near Chicago and State in the late 1990s, Fonseca said.

Skating is “definitely his passion,” Fonseca said. “He’s an advocate for it.”

Fonseca said Destin is “very outgoing, very the man on the scene.” He also
loves soccer and began a Sunday soccer league with Fonseca: “We usually just
go out there, play soccer no pressure,” Fonseca said. “Everyone just brings
their kids and we hang out.”

Friends will gathered last Sunday night at fundraiser at Rodan, where Destin
organized DJ acts every Friday. The outing at 1530 N Milwaukee Ave was
initially planned by Destin to celebrate a friend’s new record, “but in light
of what’s happened we’re making this all about Reggie,” friends said in a
Facebook post.

when the suspect was wrestled to the ground by several bystanders.

The Tuesday night incident was caught on camera in the city's Uptown
neighborhood.

The would-be purse snatcher was manhandled by Good Samaritans.

Eyewitness video, taken by an ABC7 producer who happened to be in the area,
shows 56-year-old Herbert Kirkwood face down on the ground after 19-year-old
Cherise Washington says he tried to take her stuff.

""He ripped the straps off of my purse and ran down Leland towards Racine to
get away,"" Washington said. ""As I was chasing after him, this lady with a
cane, she tripped him and he fell.""

Washington decided to leave the bus stop and walk to her part-time job a few
blocks north at the Admiral Theatre. As she struggled with Kirkwood the
student was amazed to see a guy jump out of his car and run the suspect down.

""This guy had slammed on his brakes in the middle of the street and left his
car there,"" said Washington. ""He got out of the car and chased him and tackled
the guy down and pinned him down, and then, by that time everybody was
surrounding him. An off-duty police officer from California -- he used to be a
police officer -- detained him.""

Adel Shaw, the owner of Spoil Me Hair Salon on the corner of Leland and
Broadway, saw the incident unfold.

""It's really alarming,"" said Shaw. ""But we live in the city, and so we see
this from time to time. It stresses you out a little bit.""

Kirkwood has been charged with one count of felony robbery.

As a girl, Washington said her father taught her to stand up for herself,
training she says just kicked in.

""I only had $20 in the purse. It was really about the principle,"" said
Washington. ""I feel like a piece of my dignity would have been gone if he took
my purse and got away with it.""

Staff report

2:37 p.m. CST  ,  November 27, 2012

A man wanted in his native Poland on charges of killing a pedestrian was flown
back home and turned over to police authorities today by immigration
officials.

Bartosz Sikorski, 32, is wanted on a reckless homicide warrant issued by a
court in Bialysok, Poland, for the June 8, 2002, killing of a pedestrian,
according to a release from U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement. Until
recently, Sikorski lived in the 5300 block of North Chester Avenue in the
O'Hare neighborhood on the Far Northwest Side, according to court records.

Sikorski came to the United States in August 2002, on a visitor's visa, and
the warrant was issued in October 2002. Sikorski failed to leave when his visa
was up. In 2007, he was convicted in Cook County on a theft by deception
charge and then failed to comply with a federal judge's order to leave the
country by April 2010. Earlier this year, he was found guilty in an identity
theft case in Chicago and was sentenced to 42 days in jail, according to court
records.

After immigration officials learned Sikorski was wanted on an active warrant
in Poland, he was arrested by federal agents again on Oct. 4 and was sent back
to Poland on Monday, according to officials.

**CHICAGO (CBS)** -- A convicted felon on parole for a 2009 robbery was charged 
with attempted first-degree murder after he allegedly shot two teenage girls in 
the West Garfield Park neighborhood Tuesday morning.

Police claim they found David Victory, 21, hiding in a gangway about 5:15 a.m.
Tuesday -- roughly 25 minutes after he allegedly shot the two 17-year-old
girls.

Officers, responding to a report of someone shot, found the two girls in the
700 block of South Kilbourn Avenue, police said in a release early Wednesday.
One teen was shot in the chest and head, police said, and the other was shot
in the arm.

As officers tended to the two teens, they allegedly saw Victory jump a fence
and run through a yard, the release said.

Police later found Victory hiding several blocks away in a gangway in the 700
block of South Kostner Avenue, the release said, adding that a revolver was
found.

Victory, of the 600 block of North Springfield Avenue, will appear in Cook
County Bond Court Wednesday morning.

In addition to facing two counts of attempted first-degree murder, Victory is
also charged with two weapons violations and possession of marijuana. In 2009,
he was convicted of aggravated robbery in 2009, police said.

The two teens wounded in the shooting are expected to recover from their
injuries after being taken in serious condition to area hospitals.

It's the last week before the winter holiday and today's news includes lots
about school safety plus of course the usual back and forth over school
closings (including on the North Side) plus -- this is news to me -- a CPS
plan to create a new, single schedule for CPS next year that CPS and CTU are
apparently working on together.  I know, strange words to see. Check it out
and get happy or angry about the possible demise of Tracks R and E.

in November. ][2]

By David Heinzmann  Tribune reporter

2:47 p.m. CST  ,  December 20, 2012

A federal judge Thursday turned down the request by Mayor Rahm Emanuel's
administration to erase a jury's finding that the Chicago Police Department
has a ""code of silence"" to protect rogue officers.

  
The ruling came in the case of the notorious videotaped barroom beating of a
female bartender by an off-duty police officer. The ruling means the bartender
will still get an $850,000 jury award from the November verdict in her lawsuit
against the police department.

U.S District Judge Amy St. Eve said the city turned down reasonable settlement
offers from plaintiff Karolina Obrycka for six years and decided to take the
case to trial ""knowing that an adverse judgment was a risk.""

  
Under these circumstances, to let the city set aside the outcome after the
jury has spoken could set a bad precedent that would deter parties from
settling cases before the public expense of a trial in the future, she wrote.

  
""The judgment in this case has ramifications for society at large, not just
the city's litigation strategies.""

  
The judge said her decision was influenced by the fact that the city
acknowledged in court that they had agreed to pay Obrycka her money now, and
not appeal the case, regardless of the outcome of the motion. Because of that,
St. Eve wrote, the needs of the parties in the case were less important than
the public's interest in a judgment that puts the ""code of silence"" on the law
books as a fact.

Obrycka's lawyer said St. Eve's ruling won't impact the former bartender in
any way. ""Regardless of how the judge ruled, (city officials) have to pay her
by the end of the month,"" lawyer Terry Ekl said.

  
Ekl said the $850,000 will all go to Obrycka because he has waived any claim
to the judgment and will take his payment in the case from the city. Attorneys
fees are the only remaining issue to be settled in the case and St. Eve will
handle negotiations over what Ekl's team receives.

  
He said he filed bills to the city for more than 5,400 hours of work in the
case and setting an hourly rate for that time will be the issue for
negotiation. Whatever the rate, fees are likely to be in the millions of
dollars.

December 21, 2012

Cook County State's Attorney Anita Alvarez claimed that ""60 Minutes""
misrepresented her in an episode about the wrongful convictions of nine
juveniles who falsely confessed. It's important to remember the two cases
involving these teenagers that motivated ""60 Minutes"" to report on the
miscarriages of justice in Cook County.

A year after the 1991 rape and murder of a 14-year-old girl from Dixmoor,
police, lacking any physical evidence or eyewitness accounts, aggressively
interrogated five teenagers until three confessed. Two later pleaded guilty
when told that their sentences would be decades shorter if they cooperated.
Not surprisingly, in nearly 10 percent of the nation's 301 DNA exonerations,
innocent men pleaded guilty to crimes they did not commit to reduce their
sentences. According to the confessions, all five teenage boys had unprotected
intercourse with the girl, yet astonishingly, none of their DNA was found in
her. Instead, the semen recovered from the victim matched a 35-year-old
convicted sex offender who had recently been paroled into her community and
had no known relationship with her. Prosecutors have not charged the man.

In 1994, a prostitute was raped and strangled in Englewood. The investigation
had grown cold until police picked up a boy who may have been selling
marijuana. Police interrogated him for two days before he supposedly
implicated four teenagers, who were convicted after each falsely confessed to
the crime. Again, there were no eyewitnesses and no physical evidence
connecting them to the deceased. According to the four confessions, each of
the boys had unprotected intercourse with the victim, yet just as in Dixmoor,
none of their DNA was present. Instead the DNA profile of the semen matched
Johnny Douglas.

On ""60 Minutes,"" Alvarez acknowledges that Douglas, now deceased, was a ""bad
guy"" but claims his background doesn't prove he committed the Englewood crime.
Douglas had been convicted of murdering another prostitute by strangulation
and assaulting others by attempted strangulation. Indeed, Douglas was tried in
a second prostitute murder case in which prosecutors introduced evidence that
he was nicknamed ""Maniac"" and had a modus operandi of strangling prostitutes.
A police report from the murder places Douglas at the crime scene and, when
interviewed by police, claimed falsely that he ""knew nothing."" His semen was
inside her, yet he claimed to know nothing?

After the ""60 Minutes"" piece aired, Alvarez criticized the TV news magazine
for its portrayal of her in a public letter and in an op-ed in this paper.
Incredibly, she never acknowledged in either communication that the young men
were innocent and never apologized for the catastrophic loss that they endured
of the best years of their lives. Instead, she vehemently fought to maintain
the convictions -- in Dixmoor waiting eight months to agree to a dismissal,
and in Englewood opposing the court vacating the convictions to the bitter
end; even after she lost, she persisted in opposing the young men's efforts to
secure certificates of innocence. They had to spend needless extra months
confined for crimes they didn't commit.

Through her actions, it has become abundantly clear that Alvarez lacks insight
into the causes of wrongful conviction, which, incidentally, doesn't bode well
for her newly formed conviction integrity unit. In almost 30 percent of the
DNA exonerations, false confessions were the primary cause. Juveniles are
particularly vulnerable. While the public may have a hard time believing
someone could falsely confess, law enforcement has long known that it happens
frequently and is trained to look for other evidence to corroborate a
confession.

The public should be equally concerned with Alvarez's inability to admit that
mistakes were made and that misconduct cannot be ruled out.

The first step to remediating mistakes and misconduct is to admit errors were
made. The admission of error is fundamental whether a shuttle crashes, a
hospital mishandles a patient in the operating room or an innocent man
languishes in prison for a crime he did not commit. If you can't admit error,
there is no hope for meaningful improvement or change. The most serious aspect
of the way in which Alvarez handled these cases is her utter unwillingness to
admit that the convictions of nine teenage boys were tragic failures of the
criminal justice system.

_ Peter Neufeld is co-director of the Innocence Project, which uses DNA
evidence to exonerate people who have been wrongly convicted and advocates for
reforms to prevent further injustices. The project represented two of the
young men in the discussed cases above. _

Surveillance video of Chicago police responding to an incident involving
Officer Gildardo Sierra on June 07, 2011.

By Jeremy Gorner, [ Steve Mills ][3] and Stacy St. Clair, Chicago Tribune
reporters

9:15 a.m. CST  ,  December 21, 2012

A Chicago police officer involved in a controversial fatal shooting admitted
that he drank ""multiple"" beers before he went to work that night, but the city
waited more than five hours to give him a Breathalyzer test, according to a
new court filing by an attorney for the slain man's estate.

  
A video of the incident shows Officer Gildardo Sierra firing three shots into
Flint Farmer's back as the Chicago man lay bleeding on a parkway early on June
7, 2011. The incident was the third shooting by Sierra in six months -- and
the second fatality, records show.

  

  * Related 
  * [ ][4]

Hours after Thursday's filing, the city settled with Farmer's estate in its
civil rights lawsuit. Neither side would disclose the financial terms of the
settlement.

  
The Police Department ruled the Farmer shooting justified, but Superintendent
Garry McCarthy later told the Tribune that he considers the case ""a big
problem"" and that the officer involved should not have been on the street
given his history of shootings.

  
Thursday's filing by the attorney for Farmer's estate indicates that Sierra
admitted during a psychological evaluation that he drank ""multiple beers""
before starting the midnight shift on the night Farmer was killed. The
psychological report also said that after the incident Sierra ""was nervous ...
about his then-upcoming mandatory alcohol breath test because he might test
positive for alcohol,"" according to the court filing.

  
The filing does not say how many beers Sierra purportedly drank or what his
blood-alcohol test showed.

  
Sierra, however, denied consuming any alcohol while being treated at Little
Company of Mary Hospital in Evergreen Park shortly after the 1:45 a.m.
shooting, according to the filing.

  
The city waited about 5 hours and 20 minutes after the shooting -- and about 9
hours after Sierra's shift began -- to administer the alcohol test, the filing
said.

  
The Independent Police Review Authority, the city agency that investigates
officer-involved shootings, referred all three incidents to the Cook County
state's attorney's office so prosecutors could determine whether the shootings
violated state criminal law, IPRA chief Ilana Rosenzweig said Thursday.

  
A spokeswoman for State's Attorney Anita Alvarez said the investigation is
ongoing. The Tribune has reported that the FBI is also investigating the
shootings.

  
The alleged failure to quickly administer a Breathalyzer test to Sierra after
Farmer's shooting reflects what has been a problem in the department. A
December 2007 Tribune investigation, ""Shielded From the Truth,"" showed that
supervisors often waited hours to administer breath tests to officers, both
on- and off-duty, raising questions about how aggressively the department
investigates shootings involving officers.

  
Indeed, the Tribune found that department officials sometimes considered these
shootings administrative matters and treated the officers with deference
rather than matters deserving rigorous scrutiny.

  
That crucial delay comes at a cost: It allows an officer's blood-alcohol level
to drop, sometimes under the legal level of intoxication. That forces
prosecutors -- if they bring a criminal case -- to extrapolate the officer's
blood-alcohol content, a move that defense lawyers typically challenge.

  
The delay in administering a Breathalyzer test also played a major role in the
trial earlier this year of Officer Richard Bolling, who was off duty when he
struck and killed a 13-year-old boy riding his bicycle in May 2009.

  
Bolling, who was stopped by police driving the wrong way down a one-way street
not far from the crash scene, wasn't given a field sobriety test until about
two hours after the crash. Nearly another three hours later, he was given the
Breathalyzer and blew a 0.079, just under the state legal limit of 0.08.

  
According to testimony, a supervisor told other officers to wait to test
Bolling until higher-ranking commanders arrived, leaving Bolling to sober up
in the back of a police car. Cook County prosecutors alleged that the
supervisors gave Bolling preferential treatment.

  
In January, a jury found him guilty of aggravated DUI, reckless homicide and
leaving the scene of a fatal accident. The veteran narcotics officer was
sentenced to three years in prison.

  
Sierra, 32, who joined the department 10 years ago, was stripped of his police
powers and has been working at the city's 311 center since the shooting.

  
He is paid about $75,000 a year, according to 2011 city data.

Legislation that would allow undocumented immigrants to apply for Illinois
driver's licenses passed through the House Transportation Committee Monday
morning and heads to the floor.

Under the plan, drivers would get three-year licenses, called Temporary
Visitor Driver's Licenses. They would be required to take driver's ed and
carry car insurance. Lawmakers believe there are as many as 250,000
undocumented immigrants on Illinois roads and that more than 40 percent of
deadly Illinois crashes involve drivers who don't have a license.

""Unlicensed, uninsured drivers pose a serious risk to every driver and
passenger on Illinois roadways, Secretary of State Jesse White and State
Police Director Hiram Grau in a joint statement.

    
""We can do better - and save lives - by requiring all drivers to have
licenses.""

The duo said approving the plan not only will make roads safer but also lower
insurance rates and strengthen the economy ""from the work and buying power of
all of our state's residents.""

    
New Mexico and Washington passed similar laws that White and Grau said have
seen traffic accidents involving uninsured drivers plummet.

    
In November, [ multiple state politicians ][1] -- including Gov. Pat Quinn,
Mayor Rahm Emanuel, Senate President John Cullerton, House Republican Leader
Tom Cross and former Illinois governors Jim Edgar and James Thompson -- joined
to support the bill. Before that 28 Chicago aldermen signed a resolution
supporting the bill that would give undocumented immigrants the chance to have
a license.

The girl was walking down the block around 10:15 a.m. when an unknown offender
approached her, pulled her into a gangway and sexually assaulted her at
gunpoint, police said.

The offender took her cell phone, iPod and fled the scene, officials said. The
girl was in stable condition at Comer Children's Hospital.

The block where she was assaulted is lined with boarded-up, abandoned
buildings. Neighborhood resident William Wallace said he believes these
buildings attract crime to the area.

""Vacant lots, vacant buildings. That's a problem in this neighborhood. They
need to have somebody living there or tear it down,"" he said.

His sister Cynthia Wallace said she saw the young victim running out of the
alley. The girl ran up to her crying and asked if she could walk with her. The
girl ran foward and was then taken to the hospital, according to Cynthia
Wallace.

The suspect is described as a black male, 16-18 years old, 5'5"" to 5'8"",
140-160 pounds with short hair and a light complexion, police said.

lying about her baby being in her car when it was stolen Wednesday morning on Ch
icago's South Side.

Jeanette Holt, 25, has been charged with one count of felony disorderly
conduct, police said.

CBS 2’s Dana Kozlov reports police rushed to a Chatham neighborhood daycare
center around 9:30 a.m. Wednesday, after Holt called 911 to report her 1997
Chevy Monte Carlo had been stolen with her 1-year-old son inside.

At least seven squad cars were put on alert to search the area.

Police conducted a massive search for the car, only to find out the child was
not inside to begin with. He had been in daycare all along.

Police sources said the boy's mother lied about the abduction because she
wanted officers to look for her car.

""We arrested her as a result,” Police Supt. Garry McCarthy said. “And we need
to do that when people make false claims like that, because … it’s very
serious, it endangers the public at large, and definitely our police officers
who may be responding in a different fashion than just to take a report for a
stolen vehicle.”

Such false reports also consume police resources at a time when the city is
only responding to 911 calls where an imminent threat is present, which was
not the case here.

“The case was she dropped her baby off at daycare. Upon signing the child in,
someone had jumped in her car, because she left her car running, and they
drove off,” said Eltonjia Thompson, owner of 4 Ever Young Daycare.

To be safe, the toddler's father was called to the daycare, and verified his
son was safe.

Thompson said it was “very stressful.”

Holt was taken into custody outside the daycare as soon as police realized she
was lying, about an hour after the search had begun.

She was due in court on Thursday.

Incidentally, it's also illegal in the state of Illinois to leave your car

The woman was walking in the 5100 block of West Grace Street when the man,
described as a 5-foot-6 130-pound Hispanic man with brown eyes, brown hair and
about 40 years old, removed her clothes and tried to assault her.

Police said a black Chevrolet Tahoe or Trailblazer with ""sport"" white lights
was used in the attack, but did not specify how.

March 1, 2013 (CHICAGO) (WLS) --  Chicago murder rates were cut in half for
the month of February when compared to the same month in 2012.

""There is a lot of credit to go out. The fact is it is one month. That's
progress, it is not victory in any way shape or form- but it is not failure,""
Chicago Police Superintendent Garry McCarthy said. Fourteen murders were
recorded in February 2013, compared to 28 murders in February 2012. Supt.
McCarthy isn't attributing the encouraging stats to any one thing.

""It has to do with our strategies, it has to do with our deployment it has to
do with our over- time. It has to do with quality of life, enforcement. One of
the things that I say constantly is the fact that it is not one thing we do it
is everything we do,"" Supt. McCarthy said.

February's 14 murders were the fewest in Chicago for a month since 1957.

In recent months, Chicago has become the focus of the national gun violence
debate. In the month of January, the city counted 43 murders; making it the
bloodiest January in a decade.

In January, a visit from the president highlighted the issue after 15-year-old
honor roll student Hadiya Pendleton was shot and killed on the South Side. Her
father says the numbers are promising, but he's not getting his hopes up.

Some experts believe that President Obama's visit to Chicago to address
violence may have helped lower the murder rate significantly in February.

Having the president and first lady here talking about violence brought the
issue to a higher level of discourse than there's ever been in the city,""
Loyola University Chicago Professor Arthur Lurigio said.

Bernard Strong and Kory Lindsey, Gage Park High School seniors, are charged
with a aggravated criminal sexual assault that allegedly took place in the
school's band room earlier this month.

(Cook County Sheriff)

COOK COUNTY CRIMINAL COURTHOUSE -- Student Kory Lindsey led a learning-
disabled girl to the band room at Gage Park High School, and then threatened
to ""never talk to her again"" unless she did what he wanted, prosecutors said
Friday.

Then, Lindsey allegedly made the 15-year-old girl perform a sex act on him
while another student served as a lookout.

Lindsey and Bernard Strong now face aggravated criminal sexual assault charges
for the Feb. 20 incident. Cook County Judge Adam Bourgeois Jr. set bond for
both men at $350,000 at a hearing Monday.

The 15-year-old student ""has the cognitive function of a second-grader,""
prosecutors said. But she knew what was happening in the band room was wrong.

""The victim indicated to the defendant that she did not want to do this, but
[Lindsey] threatened the victim that he would never talk to her again unless
she complied,"" Assistant State's Attorney Jennifer Sexton said during the
teens' bond hearing.

Sexton said last week, Lindsey allegedly led the girl out of the lunchroom to
the band room on the third floor of the school at 5630 S. Rockwell St. There,
behind a filing cabinet, he allegedly forced her to perform a sex act while
Strong stood watch at the door, Sexton said.

At that point, more students came into the room. When an ROTC instructor
entered the band room, all the students except Strong fled, prosecutors said.

Defense attorney Jack Wilk, appearing in court on behalf of both men, said
Lindsey and Strong, both 18, are on the Gage Park wrestling team.

In arguing for a low bond amount, Wilk said Lindsey lives with his mother and
three sisters on the South Side, and that Strong is staying with the reverend
of a neighborhood church.

A CPS official said the district could not comment on the incident due to
privacy concerns.

No one responded at the home of Lindsey Friday night. Strong's mother and
sister told DNAinfo.com Chicago Friday night they were advised by their
attorney not to talk to the media about the incident.

Chicago Police Supt. Garry McCarthy said Monday there wasn't ""a doubt in my
mind"" that police will catch 6-month-old Jonylah Watkin's killer.

(DNAinfo/Quinn Ford)

CHICAGO LAWN -- A week after [ 6-month-old Jonylah Watkins ][2] was fatally
shot, police Supt. [ Garry McCarthy ][3] said police have made progress toward
finding the baby's killer.

""We are going to close this case,"" McCarthy said Monday. ""There's not a doubt
in my mind.""

Shortly before 1 p.m. March 11, Jonathan Watkins was sitting with his daughter
[ in a minivan parked ][4] in the 6500 block of South Maryland Avenue when a
gunman emerged from a gangway and opened fire, police said.

Both were struck and taken to different hospitals. Jonylah was pronounced dead
early the next morning after undergoing extensive surgery at Comer Children's
Hospital at the University of Chicago.

At his now weekly news conference calling for stricter gun control laws,
McCarthy said some of what was initially reported about the Watkins shooting
was not true.

""First of all, [Jonathan Watkins] was not changing the baby's diaper when this
occurred, and we found no evidence that the mother, his wife, was ever shot,""
McCarthy said, referring to statements by relatives of Jonylah's mother, who
said [ Judy Watkins ][5] was shot while pregnant with Jonylah.

McCarthy said police believe Watkins was sitting in the driver's seat of the
van with Jonylah on his lap when the shooter approached from the sidewalk and
shot ""over his right shoulder.""

""The other thing that was significant was the baby was hit with one bullet,
not five,"" McCarthy said.

McCarthy said Jonathan Watkins is talking with police.

""At this point, we think there's a lot more he could help us with, but he is
cooperating with the investigation,"" McCarthy said, crediting the [ Rev. Corey
Brooks ][6] for ""an amazing job of really trying to get that to happen.""

At the news conference, McCarthy continued to call for stricter gun laws in
Illinois that he said will help lower crime and reduce the flow of guns onto
Chicago's streets. McCarthy said police have seized 1,400 guns so far in 2013.

McCarthy advocated a legal requirement to report the loss, sale or transfer of
a gun, something he said will make it easier to clamp down on ""straw
purchases.""

The superintendent also called for a mandatory minimum sentence of three years
for serious gun offenses, with a requirement that those convicted serve at
least 85 percent of the sentence. The current mandatory minimum for such
crimes is a year in jail.

89306,L,http://chicago.cbslocal.com/2013/04/15/two-explosions-at-boston-marathon-finish-line/,,Chicago On Alert After Boston Marathon Explosions,"**(CBS/AP)** –The head of the Chicago Marathon says the fatal explosions near th
e Boston Marathon finish line Monday underscore the importance of security at th
e major events.

But Carey Pinkowski, who was in Boston with his staff, says it’s premature to
start thinking about wholesale changes at his city's race. Chicago’s starting
and finish line is tightly controlled, he says.

“The start and finish line in Chicago is a highly secured area. We block
traffic off; it’s fenced in. We have our contracted security and we work with
the police. It’s something that we’re routinely aware of,” Pinkowski told 670
The Score on Friday as he was making his way back to Chicago.

He said there were likely several Chicago-area residents participating in the
Boston Marathon. There were 15 to 20 locals on his flight to Boston alone over
the weekend.

“The Chicago Marathon is one of the largest qualifiers for the Boston Marathon
so there were a lot of people from the Chicago Marathon that were
participating today,” Pinkowski said. “It’s a big tradition for Chicagoans.”

Pinkowski, who was watching television coverage of the aftermath of the
explosions, said the scene was ""surreal.""

“A marathon is a celebration of humanity,” he said. “You have some of the
greatest athletes in the world upfront and then you have people of all
different abilities from all around the world that are celebrating a personal
commitment and dedication and challenge.”

Runner Heather Corcoran of the St. Charles-Geneva area tells WBBM Newsradio
she heard and felt the first explosion from the 10th floor of her hotel, two
blocks from the finish line.

“It’s terrifying, it’s terrifying. I think everybody here, probably the first
thing that goes through their mind is 9-11,” she says. “You just pray, you
just pray.”

Sandy Borgman, from Glen Ellyn, just finished running the marathon in under
four hours when the explosions happened.

“I heard it. I finished a couple of minutes before it happened I don’t even
know how long it takes so long to get out of the runner corral, and I picked
up my stuff and I was meeting my friend one block over from Boylston Street,
so I had called my friend and we met up and we were probably two blocks away
from the explosion,” said Borgman.

Borgman says she and her friend got away from the area as soon as possible and
she contacted her family.

Three people are dead and more than 100 injured after two bombs went off near
the Boston Marathon finish line Monday afternoon. It happened around 2:50 p.m.
outside Marathon Sports on Boylston Street as thousands of runners were
finishing the race.

An Aurora couple's first reaction after the explosions at the Boston Marathon
was to find each other.

Steven Mayer was in Boston to cheer on his wife, Jamie. He told Newsradio that
he ""just heard a big explosion, it sounded like lighting, it hit next me, the
ground shook a little bit.""

Jamie Mayer had just crossed the finish line.

She said after she heard the blast ""no one was panicking quite yet, no one
knew exactly what it was. And my husband was much closer and called me
panicking, saying 'Get out, something bad has happened,' and then I knew.""

The Mayers found each other and Jamie has concerns about her running future.

""At the same time, I think bad stuff can happen anywhere at any time and this
is just another horrible example of that. I don't know that it would keep me
from running, it's just another reminder that the world can be really scary
sometimes.""

Meanwhile, Chicago’s Office of Emergency Management and Communication sought
to reassure residents that authorities are being vigilant here.

“We are closely monitoring events as they unfold in Boston and the City of
Chicago’s public safety departments are actively communicating with our law
enforcement partners both locally and throughout the country. At this time, we
are not aware of any additional threats,” OEMC said in a written statement.

Illinois Gov. Pat Quinn said his administration also is on top of potential
threats.

“I have directed all of the state’s public safety agencies – including the
Illinois State Police, Illinois Emergency Management Agency, Illinois
Department of Military Affairs and Office of the State Fire Marshal – to stand
ready to assist and remain vigilant in responding to and reporting suspicious
activity. As always, the people of Illinois should be aware of activities
around them and report anything suspicious to local law enforcement
officials,"" he said.

There was no immediate word on the motive or who may have launched the attack.
Some 27,000 runners took part in the 26.2-mile race, one of the world's
premier marathons.

""There are people who are really, really bloody,"" said Laura McLean, a runner
from Toronto, who was in the medical tent being treated for dehydration when
she was pulled out to make room for victims of the explosions. ""They were
pulling them into the medical tent.""

Mayor Emanuel said he talked with Boston Mayor Thomas Menino by phone to offer
his support.

""The running of the Boston Marathon and Patriots Day are time-honored
traditions. While the details of today’s tragedy are still unclear, one thing
was immediately known: the patriotism and professionalism of public servants
and first responders.  Our hearts go out the first responders, runners,
volunteers and spectators in Boston today,"" Emanuel said in a written
statement.

Illinois Gov. Pat Quinn said he was conferring with the state's top emergency-
management official.

About two hours after the winners crossed the line, there was a loud explosion
on the north side of Boylston Street, just before the photo bridge that marks
the finish line. Another explosion could be heard a few seconds later.

The Boston Marathon said that bombs caused the two explosions and that
organizers were working with authorities to determine what happened. The
Boston Police Department said two people were killed and 23 others injured.

A senior U.S. intelligence official said the two other explosive devices found
nearby were being dismantled. The official spoke on condition of anonymity
because he was not authorized to discuss the findings publicly.

A third explosion was heard about an hour after the first two after
authorities warned spectators to expect a loud noise from a water cannon that
police apparently were using to destroy one of the devices.

Competitors and race volunteers were crying as they fled the chaos.
Authorities went onto the course to carry away the injured while race
stragglers were rerouted away from the smoking site.

Roupen Bastajian, a 35-year-old state trooper from Smithfield, R.I., had just
finished the race when they put the heat blanket wrap on him and he heard the
first blast.

""I started running toward the blast. And there were people all over the
floor,"" he said. ""We started grabbing tourniquets and started tying legs. A
lot of people amputated. … At least 25 to 30 people have at least one leg
missing, or an ankle missing, or two legs missing.""

A Boston police officer was wheeled from the course with a leg injury that was
bleeding.

""There are a lot of people down,"" said one man, whose bib No. 17528 identified
him as Frank Deruyter of North Carolina. He was not injured, but marathon
workers were carrying one woman, who did not appear to be a runner, to the
medical area as blood gushed from her leg.

Smoke rose from the blasts, fluttering through the national flags lining the
route of the world's oldest and most prestigious marathon. TV helicopter
footage showed blood staining the pavement in the popular shopping and tourist
area known as the Back Bay.

Cherie Falgoust was waiting for her husband, who was running the race.

""I was expecting my husband any minute,"" she said. ""I don't know what this
building is … it just blew. Just a big bomb, a loud boom, and then glass
everywhere. Something hit my head. I don't know what it was. I just ducked.""

Runners who had not finished the race were diverted straight down Commonwealth
Avenue and into a family meeting area, according to an emergency plan that had
been in place.

CHICAGO (Sun-Times Media Wire) -

A man tried to abduct a 12-year-old girl by grabbing her near a wooded area in
the northwest suburbs on Wednesday, but she escaped by biting his hand and
running away.

Cook County Sheriff's police spokeswoman Sophia Ansari said the girl was
sitting near a pond on the south side of the 9600 block of Golf Road around
5:15 p.m. when she was startled by a man who approached her.

As the girl began to walk away, the man grabbed her and tried to drag her into
a nearby wooded area, Ansari said. But as the man covered the girl's mouth,
she fought back by biting his hand, allowing her to escape and run home.

Police searched the area using a helicopter and K-9 units, but were unable to
locate the suspect, though a pair of white headphones the victim had been
wearing were reportedly found.

Ansari said the girl was alone at the time of the attempted abduction, which
occurred between Golf Road and the Bay Colony residential neighborhood east of
I-294.

On Thursday, East Maine School District 63, Park Ridge-Niles School District
64, and Maine Township High School District 207 notified parents and students
about the abduction attempt. District 63 students were advised not to walk
alone.

Sheriff's police released a sketch of the suspect, who was described as a
white man, 20 to 30 years, 5-foot-8 to 5-foot-10 and 170-190 pounds. He was
wearing an orange and brown hooded sweatshirt, and black and white pants.

Anyone recognizing the man or having information is asked to contact sheriff's
police at (708) 865-4896.

Before being sentenced for causing a deadly road rage crash, Michael Moreno
sought mercy from a DuPage County judge and forgiveness from the relatives of
his victim.

He received some sympathy from Judge George Bakalis, who imposed a 10-year
prison term — far less than the 20-year sentence sought by prosecutors.

But relatives of 63-year-old Gerald Puglise weren’t ready Wednesday to accept
Moreno’s teary apology or offer any forgiveness.

“Not from me,” said Puglise’s son, Matt, after Moreno was ordered to prison
for triggering the June 13, 2012 crash in Naperville.

“I think I can at some point. Not today,” added Gerald Puglise’s stepson, Aldo
Datoli.

Moreno, 32, was convicted earlier this year of felony DUI and leaving the
scene of a fatal crash in connection with Gerald Puglise’s death.

The Plainfield man was angrily chasing another car he claimed had previously
cut him off when he turned left through oncoming traffic at Ogden and River
roads, prosecutors said.

Puglise wasn’t involved in that altercation, but died when his motorcycle
slammed into Moreno’s Infiniti M45 sedan in the intersection. Tests after the
crash showed Moreno had traces of cocaine and marijuana in his system, though
his attorneys argued at his trial he wasn’t impaired.

Gerald Puglise, a retired electrician from Lombard, had alcohol and a
prescription painkiller in his body when he died, tests later showed.
Prosecutors have contended his actions played no role in the crash.

Moreno sobbed as he apologized, saying he will be haunted by Puglise’s death
for the rest of his life.

“I’m filled with the utmost guilt and deep regrets,” he said, looking across
the courtroom at more than a dozen of Puglise’s relatives and friends. “Please
find it in your hearts to please forgive me.”

Bakalis said he believed Moreno — the father of two young sons — was genuinely
remorseful.

“He’s distraught,” Bakalis said of Moreno, who has four prior felony
convictions.

Puglise’s relatives wanted a longer prison term for Moreno, who likely will
spend about six years behind bars.

“It’s disappointing,” Datoli said of the sentence. “I don’t think justice has
truly been served.”

6:29 p.m. CDT  ,  June 3, 2013

A Cook County  judge today sentenced a north suburban mother of two who
authorities say posed as a licensed drug counselor to five years in prison for
depositing into her own bank account insurance checks made out to one of her
clients.

Kimberly Even, 48, pleaded guilty to the forgery charge at the Skokie
courthouse last month. She was sentenced by Judge Garritt Howard today.

Five years is the maximum penalty allowed by law, but Howard said Even had a
long criminal history and deserved to be harshly punished for her crimes.

""I know what you are,"" Howard said to Even prior to sentencing. ""You are a
common thief.""

Authorities say Even also claims to be a licensed drug counselor, though she
has never been officially certified as such. She was arrested in October 2011
by Glencoe police and charged with forgery, related to $16,600 in insurance
checks made out to a Fox River Grove client that Even deposited in her Glencoe
bank account [ . ][5]

Even also faces a misdemeanor theft charge in McHenry County in that incident,
and an arrest warrant has also been issued out of Utah for her arrest on
forgery and unlawful use of a credit card, according to authorities. Even has
been jailed on $75,000 bail since her arrest.

In asking for the maximum penalty, prosecutors said Even has swindled people
and organizations of out tens of thousands of dollars.

During the sentencing hearing, a Lincolnwood police officer testified that
Even stole about $45,000 from a children's hockey association that her son
belonged to in that suburb in 2003. A retired Highland Park police officer
said that Even used a bad check to pay a bill in that community in 2003 and
then tried to pay the bill and a car lease with a credit card that did not
belong to her. Charges in those and other cases were dropped after a member of
Even's family in Highland Park made restitution to the victims, prosecutors
said.

In October 2009, the Illinois Department of Financial and Professional
Regulation completed a yearlong review and fined Even $10,000 for ""unlicensed
practice of social work,"" records show. The state Department of Human Services
revoked her business license in December 2010, shutting down her North Shore
Adolescent Recovery Center in Northfield. In February 2010, a Sangamon County
judge ordered her not to represent herself as a certified alcohol and drug
counselor.

But Even continued writing bad checks and identifying herself as either a
certified alcohol and drug counselor or a licensed clinical social worker,
officials said. It is a crime to practice medicine without a license, but no
criminal law in Illinois prevents someone from claiming to be a certified drug
counselor, said authorities.

Cook County Assistant State's Attorney Michelle Gemskie today called Even ""a
liar and a thief"" and asked that she be sentenced to the maximum five years in
the Illinois Department of Corrections.

Gemskie said that over the years Even ""has caused a lot of people a lot of
pain"" and that she continually abused people's trust while taking advantage of
them.

""It's time for her to pay,"" Gemskie said.

Even did not apologize for her crimes, but instead told the judge that she
deserved leniency because she has tutored and taught other inmates while in
jail.

""You can't keep doing this to people,"" Howard said. ""You're stealing money
from kids. That's a terrible thing to do.""

_ Posted: _ _ Updated: _

CHICAGO (Sun-Times Media Wire) -

Chicago rapper Chief Keef was served Monday in a second paternity lawsuit as
he appeared in a Cook County courtroom to plead guilty to a speeding
violation.

The suit was filed a week ago in Cook County Circuit Court against the 17
-year-old rapper, whose real name is Keith Cozart. No further information
about the case was immediately available.

Another paternity case was filed against Keef on Dec. 11 in Cook County
Circuit Court.

The troubled teenager -- most recently in the news for a cameo on Kanye West's
latest album ""Yeezus"" -- pleaded guilty Monday to driving 110 mph on the Edens
Expy. last month in his black 2011 BMW. He was charged with speeding 40 mph
over the limit -- a misdemeanor.

Keef, who was driving on a learner's permit when he was stopped in a 55 mph
zone in Northfield on May 27, must pay a $531 fine, serve 18 months of
probation, complete 60 hours of community service and undergo random drug
tests.

Keef has served time in juvenile detention for pointing a gun at Chicago
Police officers. He was sent back to juvenile detention earlier this year for
a violation of his parole for handling a firearm in a promotional video.

Keef, who grew up in Englewood, currently lives in Northbrook. He gained
notoriety last year for a gloating tweet sent from his account after the
slaying of a rival rapper.

Keef faces a court hearing on Wednesday in the child-support case filed last
year.

The plaintiff, 18-year-old Jasmine Woodford, has accused Keef of contempt for
failing to pay the full amount of child support ordered in the case, said her
attorney, George M. Sanders.

On April 17, a judge ordered the rapper to pay $2,600 a month in child support
for their 1-1/2-year-old daughter, plus $500 a month for daycare, Sanders
said. Keef owed $2,100 on May 17, but only paid $1,900 of that, he said.

By Amanda Marrazzo  Special to the Tribune

5:26 p.m. CDT  ,  June 21, 2013

Prosecutors had asked a judge this morning to revoke the bond a man who had
served time for killing a family while driving drunk in 1999 and is again
facing charges for driving under the influence and missed a court date this
week.

But Walter Depner remains free after McHenry County Circuit Court Judge Sharon
Prather denied the request.

Depner, 61, served 12 years for killing four members of the Burleson family
while they were on there way home from Six Flags Great America in 1999.

Depner was arrested again in February while still serving two years of
probation, and has been charged with aggravated DUI and aggravated DUI with a
prior conviction for reckless homicide, driving on a revoked license, and
driving on a revoked license with a prior conviction for reckless homicide.

Authorities have said Depner took a prescription drug that was not his own in
the latest case. He was arrested after driving his girlfriend's car into a
ditch, then entering a stranger's house Feb. 24.

Depner, who is out on a $60,000 bond, missed a court appearance Wednesday and
a warrant was issued for his arrest.

This morning he appeared in court and Prather quashed the arrest warrant.
Prosecutors asked that his bond be revoked and he be taken into custody.

His criminal history ""can be summed up as an absolute menace to society,"" said
prosecutor  Robert Zalud.

Zalud said that Depner should know the importance of court dates, given his
past experience with the law.

Defense Attorney Mark Facchini said that Depner was just late for his
Wednesday court appearance, though he did show up after the time it had been
scheduled. Depner is scheduled for arraignment on the latest charges July 12.

_

  
Washington, DC  Today, the Supreme Court struck down a central part of the
Voting Rights Act, invalidating crucial protections passed by Congress in 1965
and renewed four times in the decades since. The sharply divided decision will
significantly reduce the federal government's role in overseeing voting laws
in areas with a history of discrimination against African-Americans.

We, America's leading LGBT advocacy organizations, join civil rights
organizations  and indeed, all Americans whom this law has served to protect
 in expressing acute dismay at today's ruling. Not only had Congress
repeatedly reaffirmed the need for this bedrock civil rights protection, but
authoritative voices from across America had filed amicus briefs urging the
court not to undermine the law: the NAACP; the American Bar Association; the
Navajo Nation; the states of New York, California, Mississippi and North
Carolina; numerous former Justice Department officials charged with protecting
voting rights; dozens of U.S. senators and representatives; and many others.

These varied and powerful voices attest to the self-evident reality that
racial protections are still needed in voting in this country. As recently as
last year's elections, political partisans resorted to voter suppression laws
and tactics aimed at reducing the votes of people of color.

Voting rights protections, which have long served our nation's commitment to
equality and justice, should not be cast aside now. The court has done America
a grave disservice, and we will work with our coalition partners to undo the
damage inflicted by this retrogressive ruling.

**Task Force attacks Supreme Court Voting Rights Act decision**

Press Release

WASHINGTON, June 25  The National Gay and Lesbian Task Force is describing
the Supreme Court's decision to strike down a central part of the Voting
Rights Act  in its ruling on Shelby County v. Holder  as a major step
backwards in the ongoing effort to eliminate racism from our democracy.

The ruling invalidated crucial protections passed by Congress in 1965 
protections subsequently renewed four times in the decades since.

""Discrimination at the ballot box is a real problem and causes real harm to
our democracy. This ruling is a major step backwards in the ongoing fight for
a truly free and fair democracy and democratic system,"" said Rea Carey, Task
Force Executive Director.

The controversial ruling will significantly reduce the federal government's
role in overseeing voting laws in areas with a history of discrimination on
the basis of race, color or membership in a language minority group.

The Task Force has joined with other LGBT and civil rights organizations to
express its deep concern with today's ruling.

""We are committed to working with Congress and continuing our work on the
ground in the states to make sure America's democracy is free, fair and
accessible for all,"" Carey stressed.

Statement by the President on the Supreme Court Ruling on Shelby County v.
Holder

I am deeply disappointed with the Supreme Court's decision today. For nearly
50 years, the Voting Rights Act  enacted and repeatedly renewed by wide
bipartisan majorities in Congress  has helped secure the right to vote for
millions of Americans. Today's decision invalidating one of its core
provisions upsets decades of well-established practices that help make sure
voting is fair, especially in places where voting discrimination has been
historically prevalent.

As a nation, we've made a great deal of progress towards guaranteeing every
American the right to vote. But, as the Supreme Court recognized, voting
discrimination still exists. And while today's decision is a setback, it
doesn't represent the end of our efforts to end voting discrimination. I am
calling on Congress to pass legislation to ensure every American has equal
access to the polls. My Administration will continue to do everything in its
power to ensure a fair and equal voting process.

REMARKS AS PREPARED FOR DELIVERY BY ATTORNEY GENERAL ERIC HOLDER ON THE
SUPREME COURT DECISION IN SHELBY COUNTY V. HOLDER

June 25, 2013, WASHINGTON, D.C.

Good afternoon. Today, the U.S. Supreme Court announced its decision in the
case of Shelby County v. Holder -- and invalidated an essential part of the
Voting Rights Act, a cornerstone of American civil rights law. Like many
others across the country, I am deeply disappointed with the Court's decision
in this matter. This decision represents a serious setback for voting rights
-- and has the potential to negatively affect millions of Americans across the
country.

In the nearly half-century since its initial passage -- in 1965 -- the Voting
Rights Act has consistently enjoyed bipartisan support in Congress as well as
the Executive Branch. After extensive hearings, Sections 4 and 5 of this
important law were reauthorized most recently in 2006, with the unanimous
support of the U.S. Senate and the near-unanimous support of the House of
Representatives. This is a uniquely legislative function and responsibility
that the Constitution expressly gave to Congress. The last reauthorization was
signed into law by President George W. Bush -- just as prior reauthorizations
had been signed by Presidents Reagan, Ford, and Nixon -- in accordance with
core nonpartisan American values.

After all, as Congress correctly recognized in the hearings held in 2006 --
racial and language minorities face significant voting discrimination in some
parts of our country. Given the successful decisions in the Department's
Voting Rights Act cases over the last 18 months, the need for a vital -- and
intact -- Voting Rights Act remains clear.

Last year, a federal court cited the value of the Voting Rights Act in
blocking the Texas congressional redistricting map on the grounds that it
discriminated against Latino voters. In that case, the court noted that the
parties ""provided more evidence of discriminatory intent than we have space,
or need, to address here."" The federal court that reviewed South Carolina's
photo ID law also noted the ""vital function"" that the Voting Rights Act played
in prompting the state to change how it will implement the statute in future
elections so that it would no longer disproportionately impact black voters.
Without the Section 4 coverage formula, neither of these discriminatory voting
changes would have been subject to review and both could have been implemented
immediately.

These are just two of many examples demonstrating that these problems have not
been consigned to history -- they continue to exist. Their effects are real,
they are of today -- not yesterday -- and they corrode the foundations of our
democracy. Our country has changed for the better since 1965 but the
destination we seek has not yet been reached. Indeed, a reading of today's
opinions demonstrates that every member of the Supreme Court agrees with this
fact -- as the Chief Justice wrote, ""voting discrimination still exists: no
one doubts that."" This is why protecting the fundamental right to vote -- for
all Americans -- will remain one of the Justice Department's highest
priorities.

The Department of Justice will continue to carefully monitor jurisdictions
around the country for voting changes that may hamper voting rights. Let me be
very clear: we will not hesitate to take swift enforcement action -- using
every legal tool that remains available to us -- against any jurisdiction that
seeks to take advantage of the Supreme Court's ruling by hindering eligible
citizens' full and free exercise of the franchise.

As the President has made clear, Congress needs to act to make sure every
American has equal access to the polls. The Department also will work with
Congress and other elected and community leaders to formulate potential
legislative proposals to address voting rights discrimination -- because, on
their own, existing statutes cannot totally fill the void left by today's
Supreme Court ruling. And I am hopeful that new protections can and will pass
in this session of Congress.

The Voting Rights Act has always had strong bipartisan support on Capitol
Hill, and today's ruling should not change that. This is not a partisan issue,
it's an American issue -- because our democracy is founded on ensuring that
every eligible citizen has access to the ballot box.

Finally, we need to be clear about what happened today. Part of the Voting
Rights Act, but not all of it, was struck down. The constitutionally protected
voting rights of all Americans remain fully intact. And the right to vote,
free from discrimination based on race or language, requires our vigilant
protection. We know from many decades of long, hard struggle that the best way
to defend a right is to go out and exercise it. So no one should conclude that
today's unfortunate decision has rendered her or his voting rights invalid, or
has made attempting to cast a ballot on Election Day futile.

To the contrary, it is incumbent on all American citizens to stand up for
their rights by registering to vote, going to the ballot box, exercising that
most fundamental of rights, and voting for their preferred candidates of any
party. Our democracy is dependent on each of us, and on our active
participation in the electoral process. Although today's decision represents a
serious and unnecessary setback, the Justice Department remains committed to
moving forward in a manner that's consistent with the arc of American history
-- which has always been a story of increasing equality, inclusion, and access
to the franchise. This is what makes the United States of America truly
exceptional. And this is what we will zealously guard.

Thank you.

The last time Yeimi Tirado saw her son, she gave him a haircut and a shave.

The teenager asked her not to touch his trademark shag that he had since he
was born but he didn’t seem to mind being babied.

“He was looking so handsome,” Tirado said.

Hours later on a spring day four years ago, Alex Arellano’s badly beaten,
burned and barely recognizable body turned up on the Southwest Side.

Arellano was pummeled with baseball bats, run over by a car, shot in the head
and burned by a pack of gang members because he refused to “throw up a crown”
in support of the Latin Kings, according to Cook County prosecutors.

“I ask myself what kind of human being does this,” Tirado said as one of her
son’s killers was sentenced to 75 years in prison Thursday.

Jovanny Martinez was one of five bicycle riding youths who accosted Arellano
as he tried to make his way to a friend’s birthday party before the May 2009
murder in the 3000 block of West 54th.

The gang bangers asked him “what he was about.”

And when Arellano said he was about “nothing,” it started the torturous chain
reaction, assistant state’s attorney John Maher said.

“My heart aches every time I think of the pain and fear that my son must have
felt trying to get away from these savages,” Tirado said in a statement read
by Maher.

Martinez, 19, made a short statement in court but fell short of admitting his
role in the crime, prompting Judge Maura Slattery Boyle to chastise him for
his lack of remorse and acceptance.

“Your young age doesn’t excuse your behavior...You knew what you were doing
was wrong,” Boyle told Martinez, adding that Arellano’s murder was the most
“savage and horrific” cases she has ever heard.

Before his murder, Arellano told Tirado he was about to be a father and had
plans to go back to school and join the Army, according to Tirado’s statement.

He was a “good boy” and was on his way to being the “best father,” Maher said,
reading Tirado’s statement.

“I cannot look at alleys or houses similar to the ones where my son was
murdered because I hurt and I start having flashbacks because all I keep
thinking is about what Alex went through how everything happened and what
happened,” Tirado’s statement said.

Two others — Alisa Campos, 26, and Edgar Silva, 22, — have already pleaded
guilty to their roles in Alex’s murder.

Campos is currently serving a 23-year prison sentence.

Silva is in the midst of serving a 20-year prison sentence.

Another co-defendant, Erick Ortiz, is awaiting trial.

An arrest warrant has been issued for a fifth person, 25-year-old Louis
Macedo, Maher said.

**CHICAGO (CBS) -** Though at least 26 people were shot this weekend – two of th
em fatally – Chicago police said gun violence is down compared to last year. 

The number of murders for the first half of the year was the lowest in nearly
50 years.

WBBM Newsradio’s Bernie Tafoya reports, for the first six months of 2013,
there were 274 fewer shootings and 76 fewer murders than the same time period
last year.

In a statement, Police Supt. Garry McCarthy said, “it's progress, and not
victory, because one shooting or murder is unacceptable.”

According to the Police Department, shootings are down 25 percent from last
year, and murders are down 29 percent. There have been fewer murders in
Chicago than any year since 1965, police said.

Overall crime for the first half of 2013 is down 14 percent from last year,
and 23 percent from 2011.

McCarthy argued violence would drop further in Chicago if illegal gun
possession carried a mandatory 3-year minimum prison sentence, and those
convicted had to serve at least 85 percent of that time.

Among the shootings this weekend, a 24-year-old man was shot and killed in the
South Shore neighborhood on Sunday, and a 27-year-old man was slain outside
his home in West Pullman.

A 26-year-old woman and her 2-year-old son also were wounded this weekend when
three gunmen opened fire near a park in West Englewood.

Staff report

3:07 p.m. CDT  ,  July 13, 2013

Bail was set at $250,000 today for a 27-year-old woman accused of starting a
fire this week that left five adults and a child injured.

  
Whitney Holmes, of the 2000 block of East 72nd Street, was charged with
aggravated arson and domestic battery.

  
Police said she set her 24-year-old ex-boyfriend's couch on fire inside an
apartment at the corner of 71st Street and Jeffery Boulevard about 10:40 p.m.
Wednesday.

  
Holmes was visiting a man she recently had broken up with when the two began
to argue at his apartment, Cook County Assistant State's Attorney Amanda
Pillsbury said.

  
The fight turned physical and the man suffered a bite mark on his back,
Pillsbury said.

  
After the man left his apartment, he saw Holmes leave the apartment building
with a window fan in her hand that  previously was in his apartment, according
to Pillsbury.

  
An arson investigation revealed that a window in the room where the fire began
was open, providing oxygen to the flames, Pillsbury alleged.

  
Cook County Circuit Court Associate Judge Israel Desierto ordered Holmes, who
police records said was a clothing store saleswoman, to be held in lieu of
$250,000 bail.

  
In addition to the six initially reported injured, as many as six additional
victims were treated.

  
The injuries were not serious, police and the Chicago Fire Department said at
the time.

UI for fatally striking a pedestrian, then trying to drive away early Saturday i
n west suburban Oak Park.

Michael D. Campbell, 21, of the 500 block of Morris Avenue in Bellwood, was
charged Monday with aggravated DUI, aggravated DUI BAC over .08, reckless
homicide, and leaving the scene of an accident resulting in death, according

The former chairman of a failed Wilmette bank and his wife, along with two
former board members, have been arrested and charged with defrauding the
federal government and misappropriation of funds.

Dr. Zulfikar Esmail, 70, owner and former chairman of Premier Bank, was
arrested by state police July 10 at his home in Evanston and charged with
being the organizer of a continuing financial crimes enterprise in conjunction
with his activities at the bank, according to a spokeswoman for Illinois
Attorney General Lisa Madigan. If convicted on the felony charges, he would
face mandatory jail time of six to 30 years.

Also arrested and charged were his wife, Shamim Esmail, 65, who sat on the
Premier Bank board, and former directors Robert McCarty, 51, of Geneva, and
William Brannin, 53, of Chicago, the spokeswoman said. They face lesser felony
charges, which don't carry mandatory prison time but are punishable by four to
15 years in prison, she said.

Dr. and Ms. Esmail were released on a collective $850,000 bond. Messrs.
McCarty and Brannin were released on bonds of $400,000 and $350,000,
respectively.

The four were charged for their alleged roles in what Ms. Madigan's office
described as a ""long-running fraud scheme to defraud Premier Bank, the U.S.
Treasury Department and the Federal Deposit Insurance Corp.""

Added Ms. Madigan's spokeswoman, ""As part of the scheme, the defendants had
access to and helped to misappropriate millions of dollars in bank funds.""

The spokeswoman said more details of the case would be announced on Aug. 6,
when the defendants are scheduled to be arraigned in Cook County Circuit
Court.

A Chicago lawyer representing the Esmails and Mr. Brannin declined to comment.
A lawyer representing Mr. McCarty also declined to comment, saying he didn't
have enough information about the nature of the allegations to respond.

Dr. Esmail, a physician, launched Premier Bank in 2000, and the lender grew to
a peak of $350 million in assets in 2009. The bank had $269 million in assets
when it [ ** failed in March 2012. ** ][11] The failure wiped out $6.8 million
in bank bailout funds it had received from the Treasury Department as part of
the Troubled Asset Relief Program.

Premier Bank not only obtained TARP funds in 2009, but the federal government
[ ** refinanced the bank into a cheaper bailout program ** ][12] in 2010 that
it had made available to designated community development financial
institutions -- lenders serving low-income or underserved communities.

The March 2012 failure of Premier Bank is projected to cost the FDIC's
insurance fund an estimated $64.2 million, according to the agency's most
recent estimates.

The bank was a [ ** defendant in a 2012 lawsuit ** ][13] filed in Cook County
Circuit Court by George Dernis, owner of the Michael's Fresh Market chain of
grocery stores. Mr. Dernis and his company had borrowed a total of $22 million
from Premier Bank, a remarkable 14 percent of the bank's total loans as of
Dec. 31, 2011.

In his complaint Mr. Dernis accused Dr. Esmail, among other things, of
pressuring him to give Dr. Esmail and his children equity stakes in some of
his stores as a condition of obtaining credit.

Five of the eight stores formerly owned by Mr. Dernis are operating under new
ownership after emerging from Chapter 11 bankruptcy. In addition, Mr. Dernis
filed for personal bankruptcy. His lawsuit against the bank and the Esmails
still is pending, but the FDIC as receiver is now the defendant in the bank's
place.

""I lost everything,"" Mr. Dernis said Friday. ""I'd really like to apologize to
my wife and my family and my creditors for everything they went through.""

![Top 9 things CPS is spending money on like it's not broke][3]

I'm sure you've memorized the number by now--the answer to every question and
the precondition for every claim. One billion. One billion. One billion. Say
it with me, One billion. If you don't have it memorized, you need to. That's
the amount of the CPS budget shortfall for FY 2014, or anyway, that's what
they say.

They said it before the school closings, which were supposed to fix the
shortfall.

They said it before the first round of firings, which were supposed to fix the
shortfall.

They said it before they announced [ $600M in central office cuts ][4] , which
were supposed to fix the shortfall, although no one can tell us exactly what
was cut (Becky Carroll: ""It doesn't work that way""), and if you compare all
the claimed central office cuts over the last six years to the claimed central
office budget, central office would have been eliminated entirely five times
over.

They said it before the announcement of the new [ per-pupil funding structure
][5] , which was going to give principals so much autonomy, but which actually
cost schools [ 90 million in budget cuts ][6] . Some schools saw losses in the
low hundreds of thousands; some saw losses as high as 4 million. (Dollars.
Just in case you forgot we were talking about money.)

They said it again before the recent round of layoffs--2100 this time.

They're still saying it.

One billion, one billion, one billion,
onebilliononebilliononebilliononebilliononbillion

The CPS adding machine is stuck. It can't write any other number anymore, [ no
matter what is slashed from the FY 2014 budget ][7] . I think maybe they need
spend a little money for a new one. Meaningful [ financial analysis has not
been a part of CPS decisions for months ][8] .

Well it gets boring talking about deficits so much. I get tired of the same
number all the time. So I thought I'd collect a few others and share them.
Here's my list of the top 9 things CPS is spending money on like they don't
have a onebilliondollarbudgetdeficit.

9. ** $47,500 ** for [ 500 new metal detector wands for elementary schools
][9] from Nova Security Group, a security company that specializes in ""less
lethal"" products. (From their Director of Sales, about their new school
product line: ""We are currently working on a 'Stun Camera' that will target
intruders and fire less lethal projectiles designed to immobilize without
causing permanent harm."")

8. [ ** $100K ** each for three north side schools ][10] who might be thusly
enticed to pipe down now and quit their complaining about closings, slashed
budgets, and firings. (Except they didn't take the money and they won't shut
up.)

7. ** $1.6M ** to nearly triple the [ CPS commitment to Teach for America
][11] . Good idea, CPS, since you're firing your teachers and aides at a
pretty rapid rate this summer.

6. ** $2M+ ** for [ Leadership Training Academy ][12] weekend training
sessions sponsored by something called The SUPES Academy for an unspecified
audience of ""educational leaders.""

5. ** ** ** $7.7M ** for a [ Safe Passage army ][13] of 600 workers and 19
vendors to escort children from one dangerous neighborhood (that of their
closed school) to another one in a rival gang territory (their potentially
not-so-welcoming school).

4. ** $18M ** for more efficient lighting in 241 schools including 9 closed
schools ( ** $538,574 ** ). CPS already paid for this but the Mayor is now
putting the squeeze on private investors [ as reported in the Tribune ][14] :
The mayor, who created a trust ""to fund public works projects the city could
not otherwise afford, is enticing private firms to pay for the school
improvements by promising a cut of the energy savings on future electricity
bills. But it is unlikely investors will see much of a return, if any, from
new lights installed in empty schools.""

3. ** $25M ** [ annual interest for 30 years on the ** $329M ** bond ][15]
they took out this spring to pay for the closings to save money and close the
onebilliondollarbudgetshortfall.

2.  ** $161M ** in new capital improvements to the receiving schools taking in
kids from the closing schools that were closed to save money, which is really
great because some of those facilities aren't in such great shape and
furthermore, [ now they're going to be overcrowded ][16] . (Actually, [ CPS is
currently working on over $900 million in projects that began in FY13 or
before. ][17] )

And finally.....

1. The Full School Day, the Mayor's signature education reform for Chicago,
adding 90 minutes of instructional time per day.

Oh, wait--they're not spending any money on that.

ied several hours after a confrontation with officers, reports WBBM's Mike Kraus
er. 

Park Forest Police say in a statement they were called to a Victory Centre
nursing home at 101 Main Street to assist a private ambulance company with
what they say was a combative 95-year-old male resident who was being
involuntarily committed for medical treatment.

According to the statement, arriving officers were confronted by the man
identified as John Warna who was threatening paramedics and staff with a metal
cane and a two-foot long metal shoehorn. Police say he would not drop the
items and instead produced a foot-long butcher knife.

Again police say he refused to comply with verbal commands to drop it and they
used a Taser which was ineffective. Officers then used non-lethal beanbag
rounds and the man dropped the weapon and was taken into custody.

Police say he was alert and talking before being taken to a local hospital. He
was then transferred to Christ Hospital where he was pronounced dead at 2:30
a.m.

Neighbors say there had to be a better way to get the man to stop waving his
cane and brandishing the knife.

“If they were smart policemen, one could have got in the front of that man and
one could have went through back door and thrown a sheet over him, put him
down and put the cuffs on him before they shot him,” said neighbor David
Atkins.

Administrators at Victory Centre say they'd never had any problems with the
resident.

“Our thoughts and prayers are with the family as we mourn the loss of one of
our own,” said Emily Powell, Victory Centre Executive Director.

An autopsy confirmed that Warna died from being hit by the bean bag rounds.

 over same-sex marriage, Cardinal Francis George defended the decision to halt C
atholic Church funding for immigrant rights groups that support gay marriage.

WBBM Newsradio’s Terry Keshner reports the Catholic Campaign for Human
Development – the Catholic Church’s anti-poverty program in the U.S. – has
withdrawn financial support for the Illinois Coalition for Immigrant and
Refugee Rights, after the group voiced support for same-sex marriage.

  * Pols Urge Cardinal To Reconsider Funding For Immigration Group
  * WBBM Newsradio's Terry Keshner

  * [][3]
  *   * [][4]

On Monday, the cardinal responded to an open letter signed by a group of
Catholic elected officials and community leaders, urging the church to reverse
that decision.

“You can’t play off the pastoral concern of the church for the poor against
the church’s teaching,” George said. “That’s exactly what was done, that’s a
cynical move, and I’m sorry that it was done.”

CCHD had provided grants to several members of the immigrant rights coalition,
but its funding agreements prohibit the groups it funds from pursuing an
agenda contrary to the church’s teachings – which includes opposition to gay
marriage.

When the church learned of ICIRR’s support for same-sex marriage, CCHD pulled
all future funding for members of the coalition unless they renounce support
for gay marriage.

The cardinal said ICIRR changed its stance, not the church.

“The church is consistent, over many years – ten years and more – in our
concern for immigrants, and just immigration reform, and that will continue,”
he said. “The CCHD has been consistent in its concern for the poor.”

A group of Catholic elected officials and other local leaders has signed an
open letter urging the church not to halt funding for ICIRR and other groups
that support same-sex marriage, accusing church leaders of using “immigrants
and those who seek to help them as pawns in a political battle.”

Those who signed the letter include Chicago Aldermen Proco Joe Moreno (1st),
Danny Solis (25th), Patrick O’Connor (40th), and James Cappelman (46th); Cook
County Commissioners John Fritchey (D-12th) and Larry Suffredin (D-13th); and
Chicago City Clerk Susana Mendoza.

By Patrick Svitek  Tribune reporter

8:44 p.m. CDT  ,  August 4, 2013

At least 10 people faced felony drug charges Sunday related to Lollapalooza in
Cook County Bond Court, including a Chicago man prosecutors say was carrying
more than 150 pills of MDMA, also known as Ecstasy.

Sean Magee, 24, of the 6700 block of South Campbell Avenue, was making a hand-
to-hand deal Friday afternoon at the three-day music festival when police
officers first spotted him, prosecutors said. They later saw him offer another
attendee ""rolls,"" a slang term for Ecstasy, according to court records.

When authorities approached him, Magee ran away and tried to get a rid of a
white bottle, the court records said.

Police found him in possession of 153 pills of MDMA -- worth more than $3,000
-- and a large bag containing seven smaller bags of marijuana, according to
the court records.

Magee was charged with a misdemeanor count of possession of cannabis, a felony
count of manufacture or delivery of more than 15 Ecstasy pills and two felony
counts of manufacture of delivery of cannabis. Cook County Judge Laura
Sullivan set Magee's bail at $75,000.

Authorities also arrested Anthony Nelson, 24, of the 4300 block of West
Fairfax Street in Oak Lawn, after he shouted, ""Who wants molly?"" on Saturday
afternoon at Lollapalooza, according to prosecutors and court records. ""Molly""
is slang for MDMA.

A nearby officer responded to Nelson's inquiry and found four bags of MDMA in
his front pocket, court records said. In total, Nelson allegedly had 27 pills
of the substance.

Nelson was charged with possession of a controlled substance. He was ordered
held in lieu of $20,000 bail.

A Metra police officer found drugs on a Chicago teen who had ignored the
officer's earlier warning about hopping the fence around Lollapalooza,
prosecutors and court records said. Dylan Horach, 18, of the 3700 block of
North Sacramento Avenue, tried again Saturday evening to cross the fence near
the Van Buren Metra station and was arrested, according to the court records.

Horach had in his possession a hit of LSD and about 4 grams of a substance he
told the officer he found on the beach, according to court records. The powder
was heroin, the court records said.

Horach was charged with trespassing on state land, delivery of less than 5
grams of LSD and possession of a controlled substance. Sullivan set Horach's
bail at $10,000.

In addition to getting guns off the streets, Chicago Police Supt. Garry
McCarthy says the best way to have fewer shooters and fewer gun victims is to
make it mandatory that anyone caught with an illegal gun goes to prison and
serves at least 85 percent of their sentence.

WBBM Newsradio's Bernie Tafoya reports, McCarthy says the crime rate is
already at its lowest point since 1965 and can get even better.

""We're at a breakthrough point, a tipping point, where could turn this thing
in a direction this city has never seen,"" McCarthy said.

If there were mandatory punishments and truth-in-sentencing, Supt. McCarthy
says 117 gun victims and shooters would have been prison and not on the street
this year.

And to those who think society should not worry when criminals are killing
each other, McCarthy says, ""It's not okay,"" even if they are criminals.

He says ""the bigger concern is that when that individual is going to retaliate
and they fire into a crowd, and they always hit the wrong people.""

On July 10, Barney Lonzo, 57, was arrested and charged for battery and a hate
crime against a fellow O'Hare Airport employee.

According to the arrest report, on June 23 Lonzo, who lives on the 4900 block
of Hirsch Street, allegedly struck and shoved his openly gay, male co-worker
against a locker while calling him ""faggot,"" ""sissy"" and ""bitch.""

The report states that Lonzo allegedly struck the victim three times with an
open hand, causing the victim to fall back in his chair and for his hat to fly
off of his head.

Formal felony charges filed with the Circuit Court of Cook County state that
after shoving his coworker into the locker, Lonzo allegedly threatened to kill
the man.

According to court documents, Bail was set at $100,000.

Under Illinois law, Lonzo could face between one and three years in a state
penitentiary, and/or an up to $25,000 fine for a Class 4 felony.

The Chicago Department of Aviation (CDA), which employs Lonzo and the alleged
victim, said in a statement to Windy City Times that it was aware of the
arrest, and had referred the matter to the Diversity and Equal Employment
Opportunity Division of the Chicago Department of Human Resources.

""As this is an ongoing police investigation, the CDA has no further comment,""
the statement read.

Lonzo's attorney did not return Windy City Times' request for a comment.

According to the Cook County state's attorney's office, which is prosecuting
the case, Lonzo's next court date is Aug. 19.

6:45 p.m. CDT  ,  August 18, 2013

Five people have been charged after three separate iPhone robberies Saturday,
two of which occurred at Oak Street Beach during the Air and Water Show,
police said.

One robbery, which was thwarted by a Chicago Park District lifeguard, happened
about 4:25 p.m. Saturday during the Air and Water Show. The victim, a 48-year-
old Lyons man, had been robbed near Oak Street Beach in the 1000 block of
North Lake Shore Drive, police said.

Officers were flagged down by citizens who told them there was a fight in the
underground tunnel leading to and from Oak Street Beach. The fight involved a
20-year-old lifeguard and the man suspected in the iPhone theft, police said.

The victim and his wife identified the suspect as the person who took the
iPhone and 25-year-old Darrell Griffin, of the 17200 block of South Greenwood
Avenue in South Holland, was arrested about ten minutes later, police said.
Griffin was held in lieu of $175,000 bail Sunday after being charged with one
count of felony robbery, authorities said. No injuries were reported.

About 2 p.m. Saturday at the Oak Street Beach at the Air and Water Show, a 27
-year-old Far South Side man told police he'd momentarily left his white
iPhone 4S and its black case under his backpack on his blanket at Oak Street
Beach when another man, 21 and from Chicago Heights, saw three boys take it,
police said.

The Chicago Heights man flagged down officers and told them he saw the trio
walking on the beach going through people's belongings, police said. When
officers questioned the boys, one of them had a white iPhone 4S in his pocket.
He told police that he ""doesn't need to steal, my mother has rolls of money,""
but could not provide the number to the phone, according to a police report.
When the victim called his stolen iPhone, police who were with the teens
answered it and the boys -- two 14-year-olds and a 15-year-old -- were taken
into custody and cited in juvenile petitions with one count of theft each,
police said.

The third theft was foiled by a valet from a North Rush Street restaurant who
chased down the suspect  after he'd snatched an iPhone 5 worth about $600 from
a 39-year-old Morton Grove man about 12:50 p.m. on a sidewalk in the 0-100
block of East Superior Street, police said.

Garland Smith, 30, of the 7400 block of South Morgan Street, allegedly fled
west on Superior Street but was taken into custody about five minutes later.
When police took Smith to the Near North District police station to be
processed, he told police that he planned to sell the stolen iPhone and had
stolen it because ""It was an easy lick,"" according to a police report.

In court Sunday, the judge set bail at $25,000 for Smith, who was charged with
felony theft.

Former Chicago Bears wide receiver David Terrell was charged Friday with
having marijuana and battering officers in the Bronzeville neighborhood,
officials said.

Officers responding about 1:20 p.m. Friday to a call of people smoking
marijuana in a building in the 3900 block of South Calumet found Terrell and
two others with cannabis and “materials to package and distribute narcotics”
in plain view, police said.

Terrell allegedly struck an officer’s hand during an interview and “resisted
and attempted to defeat the arrest,” police said. A second officer also
suffered a hand injury while taking Terrell into custody.

Both injuries were non-life-threatening, police said.

Both injuries were non-life-threatening, police said.

Terrell, of the 1800 block of South Calumet, was charged with one felony count
of manufacture or delivery of 30-500 grams of cannabis, and one misdemeanor
count of battery, authorities said.

On Saturday, Judge Laura Sullivan ordered Terrell held on a $20,000 bond, Cook
County State’s Attorney’s office spokeswoman Lisa Gordon said.

Terrell posted the required 10 percent — $2,000 — after his bond hearing and
was released prior to being assigned a jail cell.

The Bears selected the University of Michigan standout with the eighth pick in
the 2001 NFL draft, but he was only on the team from 2001-04. Terrell started
15 games and had 42 receptions for 699 yards and a touchdown in his final
season with the Bears. He played one game for the Denver Broncos in 2005, his
final season in the NFL.

Terrell is either age 34 or 35. Police said Terrell was born April 13, 1978,
but the NFL lists his birthday as March 13, 1979.

Terrell will be back in court Sept. 3, according to the state’s attorney’s
office.

A naked man was Tasered by police Friday night after he jumped on and
shattered the window of a Mercedes on the Near West, Chicago Police said.

Officers were summoned to the 1400 block of West Randolph shortly about 8
p.m., after people called 911 to complain about a naked man jumping on cars,
police said.

They found the 22-year-old still naked, sitting in a puddle of water, police
said. The owner of a nearby 2008 Mercedes said the man had shattered the front
windshield of the vehicle.

The man allegedly became combative with police trying to arrest him, and
officers Tasered him, police said.

He was taken to Mount Sinai Hospital for treatment, police said. No one else
was hurt.

The man may have been under the influence of narcotics, police said.

The arrest happened a block from Union Park, where the North Coast Music
Festival is taking place this weekend.

Charges were pending against him as of early Sunday.

There may be some good news at last for ex-Chicago Ald. Sandi Jackson, wife of
disgraced Congressman Jesse Jackson Jr.

""The hottest rumor to come down the political pike: Speculation President
Barack Obama may pardon former Ald. Sandi Jackson before he leaves office in
January 2017,"" Sun-Times political reporter Michael Sneed said Monday.

The couple was sentenced to prison time in August after pleading guilty using
some $750,000 in campaign funds for lavish and often bizarre personal
expenses. The former congressman was sentenced to 30 months of jail time for
his illegal spending while his wife was sentenced to one year for filing false
tax returns.

Jackson Jr. begins his prison term Nov. 1. Sandi Jackson's lawyers were able
to get an order from the judge allowing her to remain free to care for the
couple's young children until her husband completes his term.

In his combined terms as president, Obama has pardoned 39 people, most
recently granting clemency to 17 felons convicted of non-violent offenses this
past March. According an analysis from ProPublica, Obama has granted clemency
at a lower rate than any other president in modern history.

If Obama were to grant Sandi Jackson a pardon when he leaves office, the Sun-
Times notes she will have already served half of her sentence.

Updated:  September 11, 2013 2:22AM

  
  

Six years before Carl Chatman was cleared of a 2002 Daley Center rape, a
lawyer with the Cook County Sheriff’s Office sent a letter to prosecutors
stating concerns that the alleged victim’s civil lawsuit “cast doubt — in the
extreme” on Chatman’s guilt.

Dick Devine, the Cook County State’s Attorney at the time, had re-opened the
high-profile criminal case.

But Chatman languished behind bars at the Dixon Correctional Center,
continuing to serve his 30-year sentence.

And the sheriff’s office, which claims it never received a follow up to its
crucial July 2007 letter, sent another note the following month, reminding the
state’s attorney’s office that it would share its case file and help in any
ongoing investigation in Chatman’s case.

Judge Michael Toomin eventually denied Chatman’s post-conviction appeal a year
later and the sheriff’s office continued waiting for the state’s attorney’s
response.

There was no word — until earlier this year, a sheriff’s office spokeswoman
said Tuesday, hours after Criminal Courts Chief Judge Paul Biebel finally
dismissed charges against Chatman, 58, and in the separate case of Lathierial
Boyd, who was wrongfully convicted in a fatal shooting outside Wrigley Field
over two decades ago.

While current State’s Attorney Anita Alvarez Tuesday cited “failures of the
past,” Devine said he had no recollection of the sheriff’s office’s letters or
its serious concerns about Chatman’s conviction.

An internal sheriff’s office investigation had revealed that a deputy admitted
he had been sleeping just feet away from where the Daley Center clerk said she
was screaming and trying to fight off the homeless Chatman.

“I’d have to look at all the information that people have . . . and refresh my
recollection,” said Devine, who is now in private practice. “Obviously, if
something was not done right, that is something I would regret, and I know
every good prosecutor would regret.”

Alvarez said neither prosecutors nor defense attorneys had heard about the
dozing sheriff’s deputy at the time of Chatman’s 2004 trial.

It was only until “recently” that he was interviewed about his actions by
members of Alvarez’s Conviction Integrity Unit, she said.

But a spokeswoman for the sheriff’s office on Tuesday disputed Alvarez’s claim
that the information about the sleeping sheriff’s deputy was new, pointing out
that his conduct had been mentioned repeatedly in a civil lawsuit Chatman’s
accuser filed shortly after the Daley Center incident. Cara Smith, the
spokeswoman, also provided the Chicago Sun-Times with the letters the
sheriff’s office wrote to the state’s attorney’s office in 2007.

Alvarez said the deputy never heard the woman wailing as she said she did and
had not woken up until fellow officers arrived after an emergency bulletin was
sent out.

“The version of the event put forth by the alleged victim in this case has no
credibility,” the state’s attorney said, chipping away at the story of the
woman who made similar claims against another man in 1979.

Jake Rubenstein, the lead prosecutor in the criminal trial, said he prosecuted
the case in “good faith.”

Asked if he regretted putting an innocent man behind bars for a decade,
Rubenstein said: “I would never, ever want an innocent man to spend any time
in prison, much less 10 years.”

As she did in her late 1970s case, Chatman’s accuser won a civil settlement —
after suing Cook County — in the case tied to Chatman. Information about the
amount of money she received in either case was not available. Alvarez’s
spokeswoman Sally Daly said she wasn’t sure the office had the power to recoup
the money in the most recent case.

Alvarez also said the statute of limitations had expired for charging the
woman with perjury.

On Tuesday night, a man who answered the door at the woman’s Chicago-area home
quickly slammed the door on a reporter inquiring about the case.

Chatman, who suffers from myriad mental illnesses, was fed details of the
assault by detectives and his Blackhawks jacket his accuser said she bit into
during the alleged attack never showed any traces of her DNA, Chatman’s lawyer
Russell Ainsworth said Tuesday.

Thomas Brandstrader, Chatman’s defense attorney during the criminal trial,
echoed Ainsworth’s statements saying he always believed his client was
innocent because “Carl didn’t know what time of day it was. . . . He was a
sick man.”

Meanwhile on Tuesday, charges were also dismissed against Boyd, who was
serving an 82-year sentence for murdering one man and paralyzing another in an
Oct. 24, 1990 shooting in the 3500 block of N. Clark.

Nine out of ten eyewitnesses couldn’t identify Boyd as the shooter and the
tenth witness, the man injured in the shooting, initially told police he never
saw his attacker but then later changed his story, Alvarez said.

None of this evidence was presented at Boyd’s trial.

Boyd, now 47, was one of the first men who sent Alvarez’s Conviction Integrity
Unit a letter asking for the re-investigation of his case.

In the note, he described his wrongful imprisonment as “being buried alive
with nobody there to hear my silent screams for help.”

Patricia Bronte, one of Boyd’s attorneys, said he has maintained his innocence
since the day of his arrest.

“ . . . Lathierial couldn’t say he was sorry. Because he didn’t do it,” she
said.

**CHICAGO (CBS) -** A 14-year-old boy was recovering Friday morning, after he wa
s shot in the back outside a South Side high school.

CBS 2’s Susanna Song reports Javier Cameron was shot in the 7700 block of
South Homan Avenue around 7:45 p.m. Thursday.

His mother, Carmelita Rice, said Javier had been playing with friends at a
park near Sarah E. Goode STEM Academy, and had walked two girls home. On the
way back, he was approached by two young men.

Two teens, possibly gang members, approached Javier from an alley, and asked
him if he was affiliated with a particular gang. When he said no, one of the
boys didn’t believe him, and punched him, Rice said.

When Javier tried to fight back, the same boy took out a gun, and tried to
shoot Javier twice, but the gun jammed.

“Immediately went to shoot him. I mean, it’s not like no aim, or nothing,
anything. He just immediately went to shoot, and the gun jammed. My son said
he heard it click, so we figure that was the gun jamming, and he heard another
click, so he thought it was a cap gun,” Rice said.

As Javier ran away, the gunman shot him in the back.

“My son, when he took off and started running, is when the guy shot a third
time, and hit him in the lower back,” Rice said.

His mother said Javier is a freshman honor student and basketball player at
Ralph Ellison High School, and also has signed up to play football.

""He's a great kid. He's not affiliated with any gang at all. I'm not one of
them parents that's in denial,"" she said.

She said her son asked her if he'd be able to play basketball again after the
shooting. Luckily for him, he is expected to make a full recovery.

Javier was in serious condition Friday morning at Advocate Christ Medical
Center in Oak Lawn. The bullet was still lodged in his back.

Rice is a member of New Beginnings Church, where pastor Rev. Corey Brooks has
been working to raise money for a new community center designed to offer kids
in Woodlawn and Englewood an alternative to gangs and the danger of gun
violence.

""Unfortunately, this happens in our neighborhood far too often, but we've got
to continue to do everything we can do to make sure that we get rid of this
type of violence,"" Brooks said.

Police said no one was in custody for the shooting as of Friday morning.

ity grant has run out, forcing the crime-fighting organization to close two offi
ces and lay off some violence “interrupters,” the Chicago Sun-Times reports.

The CeaseFire office in North Lawndale closed at the end of August, and one in
Woodlawn will end operations in late September, said the Rev. Robin Hood, who
worked for the group out of North Lawndale. He said that as a community
leader, he is continuing anti-violence work as a volunteer but that a dozen
part-time staffers were let go.

Other CeaseFire locations, such as in Roseland and Englewood, are unaffected
because they run with backing from state grants, said Hood and James
Highsmith, program manager in Englewood.

Money from the city’s one-year grant ran out in August, said Brian Richardson,
a spokesman for the city’s Department of Public Health, which administered it.
Richardson said it’s possible that CeaseFire could qualify for another award.

Hood said discussions involving supportive alderman and the city are underway.
“They’re talking now, but the problem is we should be on the ground now,” he
said.

He said interventions by the group have led to a 75 percent reduction in
shootings and homicides since August 2012.

“This summer we had guys that had been shooting each other actually working
together. I’ve been with CeaseFire since 2002 and I’ve never seen anything
like it,” he said.

Highsmith said the closings should not affect other offices, such as his own.
He said Englewood has seen a 42 percent reduction in shootings year-to-date
compared with the same period in 2012.

Police reaction to CeaseFire has been mixed.

In the early months of the contract with the city, one ranking police source
complained that CeaseFire was not providing timely information about its
mediation of gang conflicts and had “no significant success stories.”

Later, when the group took credit for a reduction in homicides, a Chicago
Police Department spokesman attributed the decrease to a comprehensive
policing strategy that includes “gang violence reduction initiative,”
“targeted narcotics initiative,” “community policing” and “a close partnership
between the Chicago Police Department and the community.”

The spokesman said at the time that the department was continuing to work with
CeaseFire “while we evaluate the effectiveness of their efforts.”

CeaseFire’s executive director, Dr. Gary Slutkin, could not be reached for
comment, and a spokesman for the group’s leaders did not immediately return a
call.

The group employs people who often have criminal records to intervene in gang
disputes and help antagonists find peaceful solutions.

former Cook County Cmsr. and 7th Ward Ald. William Beavers.

At approximately 9 a.m., Beavers was expected to learn if he would face jail
time for filing false tax returns.

Prosecutors are recommending a 21-month prison sentence, but Beavers says he
should receive probation and no prison time.

September 27, 2013 (CHICAGO) --  A Cook County Jail inmate collapsed and died
Thursday morning while he was being released from the jail after serving a
two-day sentence, authorities said.

Roosevelt Gray, 26, of Calumet City was booked into the jail on Tuesday after
being convicted of driving on a suspended license, Cook County Sheriff's
spokesman Ben Breit said.

Gray was being discharged Thursday when he collapsed in the jail's receiving
room at 10:54 a.m., Breit said.

He was alert as he was taken from the receiving room to Cermak Hospital, the
hospital on the jail compound at 3015 S. California Ave., Breit said.

But he became unresponsive at the hospital and was transferred to Saint
Anthony Hospital, where he died at 11:40 a.m., according to Breit and the Cook
County Medical Examiner's office.

An autopsy is scheduled for Friday for Gray, who lived in the 300 block of
East 153rd Street in Calumet City. Sheriff's police are investigating.

A teenage boy started playing video games after the severely battered baby he
was caring for stopped crying and eventually died last week, Cook County
prosecutors said Tuesday.

Willie Brown, 17, who is facing murder charges in 4-month-old Demari Brown’s
death, was the primary caregiver of the baby in his girlfriend’s home in the
6000 block of South Honore, Assistant State’s Attorney Heather Kent said.

Police said Brown was the dead child’s father. But Kent said Demari was
Brown’s girlfriend’s baby.

At the hospital where the baby was taken, when Demari’s mother asked Brown
what he did to the baby, he allegedly cried and said, “I’m sorry. I’m sorry.”

Brown was the only one with Demari in his bedroom when the crying baby
suddenly stopped making sounds, Kent said.

Brown left the bedroom and went to play video games, Kent said.

A short time later, someone else went into the bedroom and found Demari
unresponsive, Kent said.

Demari suffered blunt trauma to the head; a linear fracture to the skull;
subdural hemorrhages; rib fractures, and healing fractures to other ribs and a
wrist.

An autopsy determined Demari died from multiple blunt-force injuries caused by
child abuse, and his death was ruled a homicide, according to the medical
examiner’s office.

Brown, of the 2400 block of West Gladys, was ordered held in lieu of $500,000
bail.

October 4, 2013

This is a picture worth a thousand curse words.

It's the image of the Cook County Circuit Court's writ of habeas corpus in a
case involving alleged armed robber Ladaris Butler, 21, and it reveals, at a
glance, just how archaic and sclerotic our local criminal justice system has
become.

A writ of habeas corpus is a document in which a judge orders a jailer --
sometimes it's a prison warden -- to produce a defendant on a certain date.

  * Eric Zorn 
  * [ ![Eric Zorn][1] ][2]

  * [ Bio ][3] | [ E-mail ][4] | [ Recent columns ][2]

In this instance, underneath all the stamps, scribbles, arrows and X's added
later, it's an order by Cook County Judge Gloria Chevere that Butler be
brought from the county jail at 26th Street and California Avenue roughly 17
miles south to the branch court at 727 E. 111th St. on the morning of April
23, 2012.

Butler had been locked up since Nov. 24, 2011, when he was charged with armed
robbery after he and another man allegedly held up three victims on the 6700
block of South Peoria Street and relieved them of a cellphone and cash.

But this court appearance was only indirectly about that. You see, at the time
of his arrest, Butler was on probation after he'd pleaded guilty in September
2011 to aggravated assault against a police officer and possession of
marijuana, and the document pictured here deals with the related probation-
violation proceeding.

The document has gone back and forth to court with Butler 18 times by the
count of Cara Smith, chief of policy and communications for Cook County
Sheriff Tom Dart, whose office brought it to my attention and interpreted it
for me.

Each time, evidently, nothing happened in court except that the old date on
the writ was crossed out and a new date was entered on whatever blank space
remained on the page, sometimes with initials or asterisks or shorthand (""OOC""
means ""order of the court""). Lately, to help out the poor jail staffers tasked
with deciphering what looks like a child's art project, dates have been marked
with a yellow highlighting pen and emphasized with arrows.

Smith said that this writ from hell isn't typical. It's a particularly bizarre
example of what happens when you have a system that's stuck in the 20th
century because vintage computer systems at either end can't talk to one
another.

If busy jail staffers overlook or misunderstand the most recent hen scratch --
here, in the upper right quadrant, the note that Butler's next court date on
the probation violation is Wednesday -- then trials can be further delayed or,
as we've seen, prisoners can be mistakenly released.

""A paper-based criminal justice system inhibits effective communication, leads
to errors, jeopardizes public safety and costs the citizens,"" Dart wrote in a
recent letter to the County Board and other top officials in which he called
for immediate electronic upgrades and attached Butler's writ as Exhibit A. ""We
can no longer tolerate this antiquated and inefficient system.""

Thursday, I asked Cook County Board President Toni Preckwinkle for her
reaction to this image. ""There is no doubt that the elimination of the paper-
driven process will lead to enhanced public safety,"" she responded in a
statement. ""We are collectively faced with the problems related to
inconsistent data collection, outdated applications to hold that data, and the
failure of most of those systems to communicate with one another.""

But even if Butler's odyssey were neatly entered on a legible, Web-based
spreadsheet program, it would still constitute evidence of dismaying
inefficiency -- the costly shuttling of prisoners back and forth for
meaningless status hearings and the preposterous delays in the dispensation of
routine justice.

One look at this 81/2-by-11-inch mess and you understand why Illinois Supreme
Court Chief Justice Thomas Kilbride intervened last month to call for a summit
including such leading county officials as Dart, Preckwinkle and Chief Judge
Timothy Evans as well as outside experts. Their charge: to audit and
streamline how Cook County deals with crime and punishment.

In the room when they meet ought to be a poster-size blow-up of Ladaris
Butler's writ, and above it a sign that reads ""No more!""

October 8, 2013 (WASHINGTON) (WLS) --  Representatives Jan Schakowsky and Luis
Gutierrez were arrested during an immigration rally in Washington, D.C.

The two say they were protesting the lack of action on immigration reform by
GOP leaders in the House of Representatives when the Democrats, both from
Illinois, were arrested Tuesday during the Camino Americano Rally for
Immigrant Dignity and Respect.

Gutierrez spoke at the event before his arrest. He urged Speaker John Boehner
to take action and call for a vote on immigration reform.

""Those of us who have the piece of paper and peace of mind that ensures our
return home tonight to our families must fight for those who do not have that
piece of paper or that peace of mind,"" Gutierrez said.

About 200 people, including other lawmakers, were arrested in an act of civil
disobedience.

2:59 p.m. CDT  ,  October 10, 2013

A second person has died in the wake of Sept. 22 head-on crash in Glenview in
which one driver has been charged with reckless homicide.

Lisa O'Brien, 34, of the 9300 block of North Major Avenue in Morton Grove,
died at Lutheran General Hospital at 4:19 p.m. on Wednesday from
""complications of multiple injuries due to a vehicle collision,"" according to
the Cook County Medical Examiner's Office. Her husband, Sean O'Brien, 37, died
at a hospital on the day of the crash.

Authorities charged Glenview resident Daniel Shmelevich with reckless homicide
on Sept. 30.

Shmelevich, 28, of 10300 block of Michael Todd Terrace, has also been charged
with driving under the influence of an intoxicating compound and improper lane
usage.

Glenview Police Deputy Chief Stefan Johnson said the medical examiner's office
notified his department Wednesday about Lisa O'Brien's death. He plans to talk
to the investigator about the case.

""We'll see if there will be more charges,"" Johnson said.

The accident happened on a Sunday at about 2:40 p.m., when a Toyota Camry and
a Kia Soul crashed in the 1000 block of Milwaukee Avenue in north suburban
Glenview.

Sean O'Brien, the driver of the Kia, was pronounced dead at Lutheran General
Hospital after he was extricated from the wreckage by firefighters, according
to the medical examiner. Lisa O'Brien was also taken to Lutheran General.

Shmelevich remains at the Cook County Jail in lieu of $600,000 bond. His next
court date is scheduled for Oct. 24.

10:51 a.m. CDT  ,  October 17, 2013

A Naperville man who had been accused of secretly videotaped young girls in
his neighborhood was sentenced Wednesday to jail time and two years of
specialized probation for sex offenders, DuPage County prosecutors said.

In a plea deal, Renzo Barduagni, 50, had agreed to plead guilty in August to
one count of child pornography, in return for prosecutors dropping six others
charges against him, including ones for unauthorized videotaping.

Judge George Bakalis on Wednesday sentenced Barduagni, of the 700 block of
Violet Lane, to serve 120 days of work release, which means he must spend
evenings and weekends in the DuPage County jail.

In addition, Barduagni, who has already served 82 full days in jail, was
sentenced to serve an additional eight full days, according to Paul Darrah,
the spokesman for State's Attorney Robert Berlin.

Other conditions of sentencing include a requirement that Barduagni register
as a sex offender and pay a $1,000 fine, Darrah said.

Barduagni was arrested in October 2012 after police searched his home after
getting a tip that he had downloaded child pornography. During the search,
police said they found child pornography as well as videotape of two
neighborhood girls. Barduagni allegedly admitted to taking the video through
the windows of the girls' residences, police said.

ed a homeless man to 20 years in prison for aggravated battery in a knife assaul
t on a man at a train station.

Jawaun Dontell Woods, 25, pleaded guilty but mentally ill to the charge in the
Nov. 26 assault at the South Shore station, 5615 Indianapolis Blvd., East
Chicago.

The victim, Chintan Shah, 29, was waiting for his wife to arrive on the train
and was using the bathroom at about 5:42 p.m. when Woods walked up from
behind, grabbed his hair, pulled back his head and cut his throat with a
knife. The man put his hand to his throat and Woods demanded the keys to his
car and threatened to kill him.

Woods then tried to stab Shah as he turned to face Woods, who continued trying
to stab the man and yelled for his keys. Shah’s left hand was slashed by the
knife as he tried to fend off Woods, who pinned Shah to the wall with his
body. Shah threw his keys, wallet and cellphone to the floor. As Woods bent
down to retrieve the victim’s property, he released Shah, who ran from the
restroom to the parking lot for help.

Woods took the man’s 2005 Honda Accord and drove away.

Deputy prosecutor Judy Massa told the judge that Shah’s winter coat with a
high collar likely saved his life. Shah received seven stitches for his throat
wound and eight for his hand wounds, and later underwent surgery on his hand
and physical therapy because of tendon damage from the attack.

Defense attorney Susan Severtson said her client has been diagnosed with
mental illnesses and was not taking his medication at the time of the assault.
Afterward, Woods drove to Indianapolis, where he fell victim to a crime,
Severtson said.

Murray, who imposed the sentence outlined in the plea agreement, said he would
recommend to prison authorities that Woods receive mental health evaluation
and treatment. “You are a danger to the community when you are not on
medicine,” Murray told Woods, who apologized for his actions.

Woods faced 20 to 50 years on charges of attempted murder and robbery, which
were dismissed along with a carjacking charge.

By Stacy St. Clair and [ Steve Mills ][12] , Chicago Tribune reporters

12:05 a.m. CST  ,  November 6, 2013

Cook County prosecutors said Tuesday that they would not bring criminal
charges against a Chicago police officer who was captured on videotape fatally
shooting an unarmed man, saying an exhaustive review showed that the officer
reasonably mistook a cellphone for a gun pointed at him on a darkened street.

The death of Flint Farmer in June 2011 was the third shooting -- the second
fatal shooting -- in six months by Officer Gildardo Sierra, a patrolman in the
Englewood district. It was so disturbing that it prompted police
Superintendent Garry McCarthy to tell the Tribune that he considered the
shooting a ""big problem"" and to acknowledge the department had erred by
allowing Sierra back on the street given the previous shootings.

In December, [ the city of Chicago settled a lawsuit ][8] brought by Farmer's
estate for $4.1 million without admitting wrongdoing.

Still, Cook County prosecutors said their two-year investigation of the
shooting showed that Sierra had reason to believe that Farmer was armed and
posed a threat of ""great bodily harm."" They said that although Sierra fired
his weapon 16 times, hitting Farmer seven times -- including three times in
the back -- they did not think they could show that the shooting was
unreasonable, a key component of proving that Sierra had committed a crime.

""Although Officer Sierra was mistaken in his belief that Flint Farmer had a
gun, not every mistake demands the action of the criminal justice system, even
when the results are tragic,"" State's Attorney Anita Alvarez said Tuesday in a
letter to McCarthy.

In addition to providing the Tribune with the letter to McCarthy, four
officials from Alvarez's staff sat down with reporters for three hours to
explain the investigation and make a video presentation. They were: chief of
staff Dan Kirk; Jack Blakey, chief of the office's special prosecutions
bureau; spokeswoman Sally Daly; and Assistant State's Attorney Nick Trutenko,
who conducted the bulk of the investigation. The Tribune ran a front-page
story in 2011 raising questions about the shootings by Sierra.

The prosecutors said although the videotape of the shooting was damning,
showing muzzle flashes and suggesting Sierra stood over Farmer as he shot him
in the back, the continued investigation yielded forensic and other evidence
that led the prosecutors to conclude that the incident was more complex.

""The video is actually somewhat maddening,"" Trutenko said. ""It's why we run
out every ground ball.""

Farmer's father, Emmett, wept Tuesday when told by the Tribune about the
prosecutor's decision. In the more than two years since the shooting, he has
attended several rallies calling for Sierra's prosecution and firing. He said
the settlement of the civil lawsuit was, in the end, cold comfort.

""That's just horrible,"" he said as his voice broke. ""I've seen the video. My
son is lying on the ground and Sierra fires three bullets into his back. You
can't tell me it's self-defense. I don't care how quickly the whole thing
happened. You can't shoot a man in the back and call it self-defense. My son
didn't even have a gun.""

Sierra's attorney, Matthew McQuaid, praised the decision not to seek charges,
saying it was the only one to make based on the evidence.

""This was never a criminal case,"" McQuaid said. ""He (Sierra) was adamant about
what happened and that he acted in self-defense.""

The shooting occurred shortly before 2 a.m. on June 7 when Sierra and a
partner responded to a call of a domestic disturbance allegedly involving
Farmer and his girlfriend in the 6200 block of South Honore Avenue.

""My baby daddy, he just jumped on me and he just beat up on me and my kids
real bad,"" Farmer's girlfriend, Tanesha Whitaker, can be heard saying on a 911
call that prosecutors played.

When police arrived, Farmer fled to South Wolcott Avenue, one street west. He
got as far as the parkway when Sierra reportedly yelled at him.

Prosecutors said Farmer, 29 and unemployed, pointed his burgundy cellphone at
Sierra, prompting the officer to fire all 16 rounds from his handgun. A patrol
car that arrived during the brief confrontation captured video of Sierra as he
stepped onto the parkway, walked around the injured and unarmed Farmer in a
semicircle and fired three more shots. That video, which the Tribune placed
online two years ago, raised questions about whether the shooting was
justified.

An autopsy by the Cook County medical examiner's office showed that the three
shots in Farmer's upper back were the fatal wounds.

Before Farmer's death, Sierra had wounded a 19-year-old man in a shooting in
March 2011 and killed Darius Pinex, 27, in January 2011. All three shootings
took place after midnight in the impoverished and crime-ridden Englewood and
West Englewood neighborhoods.

The Police Department ruled Farmer's shooting justified, but McCarthy later
told the Tribune, without identifying Sierra by name, that he considered the
case ""a big problem"" and that the officer involved should not have been on the
street. Sierra later admitted that he drank ""multiple"" beers before he went to
work that night, but the city waited more than five hours to give him a breath
test, according to a court filing by an attorney for the slain man's estate.

The Independent Police Review Authority, the city agency that investigates
shootings involving officers, referred all three shootings by Sierra to
prosecutors for possible criminal prosecution. The FBI also had been
investigating the shootings, but it is unclear where that inquiry stands.
Sierra, 33, who joined the department 11 years ago, was stripped of his police
powers and has been assigned to desk duty since the Farmer shooting.

Rescue crews responded to the crash about 11:13 p.m. on southbound I-55 near
the I-355 interchange, according to the Illinois State Police.

One adult and two children, whose ages were not immediately known, were taken
with non-life-threatening injuries to Adventist Bolingbrook Hospital in
Bolingbrook, police said.

The left and center lanes of southbound I-55 were closed for about 20 minutes
while rescue crews were on the scene, police said.

It was unknown early Wednesday why the car crashed into the highway’s wall as
Illinois State Police were investigating. No citations have been issued,
police said.

tigating three recent arsons that were reported over one week in south suburban 
Ford Heights.

The first fire was ruled an attempted arson at a store in the 1300 block of
East Lincoln Highway about 5 a.m. Nov. 5, according to a statement from the
sheriff’s office.

Firefighters put out flames on the store’s roof before any structural damage
occurred, but there was a strong gasoline odor, police said.

The second fire fully engulfed a home and damaged the roof of another in the
1500 block of Senator Lane about 5:30 a.m. Nov. 9, authorities said.

A third fire was reported about 12:50 a.m. Nov. 12 at a convenience store in
the 1400 block of 13th Place, authorities said.

Security camera footage of the third fire showed an unidentified car pulling
up to the building, with a person from the passenger side getting out of the
vehicle and placing something near or in the window where the fire started,
before driving off in the car, police said.

The footage showed two people in dark clothing then returning a few minutes
later, walking to the window. The fire then started before the two ran north
on Woodlawn Avenue and then turned east on 13th Place, police said.

Police have not determined if any of the cases are related, the statement
said.

Cook County Sheriff’s deputies are investigating.

Anyone with information on the incidents is asked to call the Cook County
Sheriff’s investigations unit at (708) 865-4896.

o were using propane torches before a raging fire broke out in a Northwest Side 
strip mall and destroyed three businesses the day before.

The Chicago Police Department’s Bomb and Arson Unit is looking into the matter
but is not treating the incident as a criminal investigation, police told the
Chicago Sun-Times.

Authorities do not believe the roofers, who fled the scene, had malicious
intent as they did work on the roof above the For Eyes optical store, in the
3100 block of West Peterson Avenue. “We have not been able to interview them
[roofers] yet,” Fire Department spokesman Larry Langford said Saturday,
explaining that police had since taken over the probe into what started the
fire in the strip mall.

Although the fire was struck out by 6 p.m. Friday, there were a couple of
“rekindles” over night, Langford said.

Feras Dajani, 34, was inside his family-owned furniture store about 4 p.m.
Friday with about two other customers when he noticed the flames and smoke
coming from the roof. Then, after rushing out, he watched not just his store,
Mid-America Furniture, but the neighboring For Eyes and an American Mattress
obliterated by a raging fire.

No one was injured in the blaze, but large heaps of dark smoke billowed from
the strip mall throughout the neighborhood for miles.

“I just stood outside and watched it,” Dajani said. “I didn’t feel like I
could leave.”

A firewall between American Mattress and a Supercuts stopped the roaring fire
from spreading any further, officials said.

After two hours, the fire was extinguished, as dozens watched. Traffic was
deadlocked for miles as 207 firefighters from 61 units responded to the blaze.

When firefighters initially responded, the fire was “raging,” said Langford.

“They couldn’t fight it (inside the business). They fought it externally,”
Langford said of the firefighters’ efforts.

All that was left besides the charred businesses was a flood of water from the
large fire response.

Dajani, who runs the store with his mother, said his customers are loyal and
most are from the West Ridge neighborhood.

He said he plans to rebuild the 26-year-old business.

“We got a lot of work ahead of us,” Dajani said.

November 18, 2013

Rare and violent autumn storms ripped across Illinois on Sunday, spinning off
tornadoes before slamming into Chicago with punishing rain and wind.

As heavy gusts toppled trees and power lines and downpours swamped city
streets, tens of thousands of Bears fans were evacuated from their Soldier
Field seats and forced to take cover inside or huddle behind the historic
stone colonnades.

Earlier, in southern Illinois, severe weather decimated farms, killing at
least five people, including an elderly brother and sister, when a tornado
barreled through their house. Farther north, near Peoria, a tornado flattened
large swaths of Washington, killing at least one person and sending about 50
others to local hospitals.

As night fell and temperatures dropped, emergency workers were still searching
debris fields that had once been neighborhoods and the homeless were seeking
temporary shelter.

Meteorologists had predicted the violent storms days ahead of time,
anticipating volatile atmospheric conditions that are freakish for a season
when tornadoes are a relative rarity. ""Weather doesn't get more extreme than
this in Illinois very often,"" said Matt Friedlein, a National Weather Service
meteorologist.

The storms exploded over Illinois when gusting winter jet streams from the
northwest collided with the unusually warm and moist air that had arrived
Saturday.

""You've got wintertime winds in the atmosphere above summertime moisture,""
Friedlein said. ""While unusual, when that happens, you're going to have very
strong storms that move very quickly.""

At Soldier Field, Bears fans scattered for cover under roiling skies as the
game was postponed because of the threat of lightning. Though rains and high
winds battered the city, temporarily closing some streets, officials received
no reports of weather-related injuries, said Melissa Stratton, spokeswoman
with the Chicago Office of Emergency Management and Communications.

As of Sunday evening, crews were working to clear streets, removing some 170
tree branches or fallen trees and clearing out about 40 flooded viaducts. The
Department of Water Management also received 27 calls of flooded basements,
Stratton said.

Across Cook County, officials were reporting relatively minor damage. Sophia
Ansari, Cook County Sheriff's Office spokeswoman, said a motorist was stuck
under 4 feet of water in Palos Township, near Orland Park. No injuries had
been reported as of Sunday evening, Ansari said.

In Lake County, trees and power lines were down, and some traffic signals were
damaged, said an official with the Lake County Sheriff's Office.

Will County officials, meanwhile, said homes were damaged and there were
reports of a tornado touchdown in Diamond near Interstate 55. The storm caused
""significant property damage"" to a local bar and a nearby church.

Charles Pelkie, information officer for the Will County Emergency Management
Agency, said some people were temporarily trapped in the church. But they were
quickly rescued, and none had significant injuries, he said.

""I-55 was a mess,"" Pelkie said. ""There were wires down -- trees, debris
blocking the road.""

In Grundy County, a powerful tornado touched down in Coal City with possible
wind speeds of 111 to 135 mph, the National Weather Service confirmed.

Washington and Pekin, communities about 20 miles apart, near Peoria, appeared
to sustain the worst tornado damage in central Illinois. Whole blocks were
leveled in Washington, prompting the Illinois National Guard to send a
10-person firefighting and search and rescue team, and officials were still
trying to determine the extent of injuries Sunday evening.

""I was hiding in the bathroom with pillows over my head,"" said Karla Riter,
who lives in Sunnydale Estates in the city. ""When I opened the door, my roof
was gone.""

The Illinois Emergency Management Agency confirmed that at least one person
had died in the area. No other details were immediately available.

Kristen Johnson, a spokeswoman for St. Francis Medical Center in Peoria, said
the hospital had treated victims with head injuries, broken bones, cuts and
bruises. Eight went to the trauma unit, though two had since been moved and
their status was unknown.

""We anticipate the worst is over,"" Johnson said.

Sara Sparkman, a spokeswoman with the Tazewell County Emergency Management
Agency, credited the county's early warning system for reducing the toll. ""We
hope that contributed to the low injuries that we are having,"" she said.

In southern Illinois, a tornado ravaged Washington County about 12:30 p.m.,
obliterating farms and livestock and killing Joseph Hoy, 80, and his sister
Frances Hoy, 78, Washington County Coroner Mark Styninger said.

Joseph Hoy's body was found in a field about 100 yards east of his farmhouse.
His sister's body was found inside the home beneath debris, he said.

""(Joseph Hoy's) house was blown away by a tornado,"" said Styninger, who knew
the siblings personally. ""They were just very nice people.""

November 23, 2013

In an online photo gallery of neighborhood picnics and sunrises over Lake
Michigan, an image of black dust blotting out the sky galvanized residents of
Chicago's Southeast Side to demand action against companies storing enormous
mounds of petroleum coke along the Calumet River.

Spread through social media, the picture taken in late August near 109th
Street and Buffalo Avenue helped revive long-standing concerns in the East
Side and South Deering neighborhoods about the legacy of pollution from now-
shuttered steel mills, blast furnaces and coke ovens that once dominated the
area.

Elected officials and regulators eventually took notice of the anger and
frustration. In the past month, the owners of three riverfront storage
terminals have faced a steady stream of lawsuits, administrative complaints
and proposed legal restrictions from the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency,
the state EPA, Illinois Attorney General Lisa Madigan, Chicago Mayor Rahm
Emanuel, the local alderman and members of Congress.

On Friday, Madigan and Emanuel filed a new lawsuit seeking to shut down the
Beemsterboer Slag Co. site at 2900 E. 106th St. until its owners obtain new
permits from state regulators. The attorney general and mayor also want
Beemsterboer's uncovered mountains of petcoke and coal removed until the
company submits a plan to tamp down the dust.

During an inspection last month, the Illinois EPA discovered that Beemsterboer
was only spraying water from a truck to prevent dust from swirling off its
uncovered piles. The company had stopped using water cannons and other
methods, according to the lawsuit.

""Beemsterboer's failure to follow the environmental laws is a serious threat
to the public health,"" Madigan said. ""The company must take action immediately
to stop the air pollution from its illegal operations.""

Company officials have not responded to repeated requests for comment.

A state operating permit allows Beemsterboer to store coal but does not
authorize the handling of petcoke or metallurgical coke, a type of high-energy
coal used in steel production, records show.

The new lawsuit, which accuses the company of multiple permit violations,
seeks fines of $50,000 per violation and $10,000 for every day the company
remains out of compliance.

Residents say dust problems have worsened since Beemsterboer and other storage
terminals started acquiring more petroleum coke, a byproduct of oil refining.
Until recently, the piles rising above the Calumet had been a largely
unnoticed consequence of a shift at Midwest refineries to thicker, dirtier oil
from the tar sands region of Alberta.

""We've been complaining about the dust for years, but this time somebody
finally listened to us,"" said Peggy Salazar, an East Side resident and
activist with the Southeast Environmental Task Force. ""I still don't know how
to explain it.""

Since the Tribune and other media drew attention to the dust problems last
month, Madigan and the EPA have filed other complaints against Beemsterboer
and KCBX Terminals Co., which owns storage terminals on 100th Street and on
Burley Avenue between 108th and 111th streets. KCBX is not named in the suit
filed Friday.

Earlier this week, Emanuel vowed to enact a new ordinance that would require
the storage terminals to either enclose piles of petcoke and coal or fence
them in with high walls on three sides, leaving them open to the river. Ald.
John Pope, 10th, and Edward Burke, 14th, introduced a separate proposal that
would ban the storage of petcoke altogether.

City officials stepped in after the U.S. EPA last week ordered monitors
erected around the storage terminals to measure lung-damaging particulate
matter.

""We cannot allow this company to openly violate laws and continue operations
that may place the health of Chicago's children and families at risk,"" Emanuel
said.

KCBX, a company controlled by industrialists Charles and David Koch, said it
recently installed 42 new computer-controlled water cannons at the Burley
Avenue site that can douse the piles with up to 1,800 gallons of water a
minute. It also is testing a system that automatically turns on the cannons
based on weather conditions and adjusts to changes in wind direction.

Much of the petcoke stored in Chicago comes from a nearby BP refinery in
Whiting, Ind., where a federal legal settlement requires the oil giant to
store any waste kept on site behind 40-foot walls. An enclosed conveyor and
loading system is equipped with windscreens and water sprayers to keep dust
down.

All of the petcoke from Whiting eventually is sent just over the state border
to the uncovered piles managed by KCBX.

By the end of the year, BP is expected to complete an overhaul of the Whiting
refinery that will make it the world's second-largest source of petcoke --
increasing its output to 2.2 million tons from 700,000 tons a year.

""We need to make sure our elected officials protect us,"" Salazar said. ""We're
fed up with being a dumping ground for everybody else's waste.""

BY JON SEIDEL Staff Reporter  December 1, 2013 4:16PM

Updated:  December 2, 2013 2:11AM

  
  

A northwest suburban man’s erratic driving Friday afternoon was so bad a
fellow motorist pulled up next to him and suggested he “learn how to drive,”
authorities said.

Joseph M. Maloney, of Streamwood, didn’t take that too well, according to a
Cook County prosecutor who told a judge Sunday that Maloney followed that
motorist home and tried repeatedly to run the other driver over — even pulling
into neighboring yards and driveways as he tried to do so.

Now Maloney, 52, has been charged with aggravated driving under the influence,
aggravated assault and reckless driving. Cook County Judge James Brown ordered
him held Sunday in lieu of $75,000.

Assistant State’s Attorney Megan Carlson said Maloney’s victim saw him driving
about 4 p.m. Friday in what appeared to be an impaired manner — driving up
onto a curb before returning to the road. The victim pulled alongside
Maloney’s 1998 Pontiac sedan at a stop sign and yelled that he learn how to
drive.

Carlson said Maloney, who was in the innermost lane, turned right in front of
his victim, who took evasive maneuvers to avoid a crash. But then Maloney
followed the other driver home and began his attack, authorities said.

Maloney allegedly tried to hit the victim — who had exited their own vehicle —
with his car three or four times, Carlson said, once even driving around the
block before trying again. Carlson said the victim’s mother was also in the
front yard during the attack.

There were multiple witnesses, Carlson said. Later, the prosecutor said,
Maloney failed a field sobriety test.

December 5, 2013 (WAUKEGAN, Ill.) --  A judge accepted a plea deal Thursday in
the case of a former Benedictine monk accused of child abduction attempts
earlier this year in the north suburbs, sentencing him to probation and
periodic jail time.

Thomas Chmura, 57, was charged with four counts of child abduction and could
have faced up to three years in prison after authorities alleged he offered
rides to a number of girls ages 11 to 14 in April in the Antioch area.

On Thursday, he pleaded guilty to one count of child abduction and was
sentenced to six months of periodic imprisonment, plus 24 months of felony
probation, the News-Sun is reporting. He must register as a sex offender for
life and undergo sex offender treatment.

Chmura never actually abducted any of the victims he tried to lure into his
car, but under state statute, his behavior qualified for the abduction charge,
according to assistant Lake County State's Attorney Victor O'Block.

Chmura previously pleaded not guilty and has been out on bond, but under
24-hour curfew in south suburban Lansing with his father.

For 32 years prior, he lived at St. Benedict's Abbey in Benet Lake, Wis., as a
monk.

Officials said he had admitted to police that he went to Antioch five to 10
times during a six-week period to offer girls aged 11-14 rides in his station
wagon, but all the girls ran away. No motive was ever publicly disclosed.

Police said that in one incident, Chmura said to a 14-year-old girl, ""Come on,
you're so beautiful, let me drive you home."" When she refused, he reportedly
told her to ""Get in the car', but she ran away, and he drove off.

O'Block said Chmura may receive treatment at the Vianney Renewal Center in St.
Louis, and that his attorney said Jefferson County officials have agreed to
supervise his probationary restrictions.

block of East 87th Street, but was shot dead by the clerk about 6:30 p.m.
Tuesday. Brandon was pronounced dead at the scene, according to the Cook

Police said there was an exchange of gunfire between Brandon and the clerk,
though it's not clear who shot first.

Brandon was paroled from the Shawnee Correctional Center this summer, where he
had been serving concurrent 3-year and 13-year sentences, according to
Illinois Department of Corrections and Cook County Court records.

The 13-year sentence stemmed from an incident in Chicago in which Brandon was
charged with armed robbery with a firearm, armed violence, aggravated unlawful
use of a weapon, gun possession, aggravated fleeing from police, and having
either a rifle with a barrel less than 16 inches or shotgun with a barrel less
than 18 inches.

That case, and the one that ended with a 3-year sentence, both ended in plea
deals, according to court records. He was credited for about 20 months time
served and admitted to IDOC custody in September 2008.

His projected parole discharge date was in July of 2016, according to IDOC
records.

Two others died and two others were wounded in other South Side shootings
Tuesday afternoon.

A 30-year-old man was pronounced dead in the Morgan Park neighborhood after
someone shot him about 4:40 p.m., said Chicago Police News Affairs Officer
Daniel O'Brien. He was shot in the 11200 block of South Ada Street, O'Brien
said.

The Cook County medical examiner's office identified him as Kevin Johnson, of
the 100 block of South Ashland Avenue.

The victim got into a dispute with a group of teenagers, and when he walked
away from them, one of them shot him in the head, O'Brien said. The shooter
was last seen running north and then west through a gangway on 112th Street.

In addition to that shooting two men were shot Tuesday afternoon in the South
Shore neighborhood, one fatally, officials said. The shooting happened in the
7100 block of South Paxton Avenue at about 12:20 p.m., according to Chicago
police and fire department officials.

A 21-year-old man was initially listed in critical condition but was later
pronounced dead at 2:52 p.m. The 22-year-old man was in serious condition at
Northwestern Memorial Hospital, officials said. The 21-year-old was identified
as Deonte Womack of the 6900 block of South Paxton Avenue, according to the
Cook County medical examiner's office.

The two were attacked on the street by three armed men or boys, who fired
multiple shots at the two. The younger man was struck in the head, neck and
shoulder, while the man who survived was struck in the shoulder and hand.

Later Tuesday, a 30-year-old man was shot in the calf in the 4700 block of
South Indiana Avenue about 9:55 p.m. Authorities found him in an apartment on
that block with the wound and he was taken to Northwestern Memorial Hospital
in good condition.

 week, Cook County prosecutors said Saturday.

James Rudzinski, 61, allegedly admitted to authorities that he smokes
marijuana everyday and did the night before he hit an elderly pedestrian in
the 6300 block of North Narragansett Avenue Thursday afternoon, the Sun-Times
is reporting.

Bronislawa Zajac, 82, was walking across the street when the delivery truck
Rudzinski was driving struck her as it was turning left at the intersection,
police said.

A drug test allegedly revealed Rudzinski had cannabis in his system at the
time of the crash.

Zajac, of the 6600 block of West 64th Place, was pronounced dead at Advocate
Christ Medical Center in Oak Lawn at 12:40 p.m. Thursday, the Cook County

Rudzinski, of Wheaton, was ordered held in lieu of $150,000 bail for felony
aggravated DUI Saturday. He also faces two misdemeanor counts of driving under
the influence of drugs and for disregarding a pedestrian in a crosswalk with
the right of way.

Rudzinski was placed on supervision for failing to yield to a pedestrian last
year, but has no felony convictions, according to court records.

The state is moving to fire a $111,432-a-year Illinois prison official with a
lengthy criminal history in the wake of Chicago Sun-Times reports that
revealed his past, sources said Tuesday.

Xadrian R. McCraven was placed on paid leave Monday afternoon, said Tom Shaer,
a spokesman for the Illinois Department of Corrections. A “pre-disciplinary
hearing” is set for Thursday under the terms of McCraven’s union contract,
Shaer said.

Shaer wouldn’t say why McCraven is being disciplined or whether the department
plans to fire him. But sources said Gov. Pat Quinn’s administration wants to
fire McCraven, a senior adviser to the IDOC chief of parole.

“In the hearing, the Department of Corrections will provide its reasoning for
seeking discipline against the employee, and the employee can provide his
rebuttal,” said Shaer, adding that the hearing will not be open to the public.
“If termination is pursued, an employee is suspended without pay pending the
termination process.”

McCraven declined to comment, as did a spokesman for his union, AFSCME Council
31.

McCraven, 44, of Chicago, has worked for the now-defunct Chicago Housing
Authority Police Department; the Illinois Department of Professional
Regulation; the Illinois Department of Children and Family Services, and IDOC
— even though he has been arrested “at least” 24 times on charges including
arson, gun possession, attempted robbery, drug possession and aggravated
assault, federal court records show.

In 1987, he was convicted of disorderly conduct; in 1989, he was convicted of
illegal possession of a handgun, and in 1998, he was found guilty of reckless
conduct in connection with a domestic battery case involving a fiancee,
according to those records.

McCraven tried to join the Chicago Police Department in 1993, but he was
rejected because of his criminal history. He unsuccessfully argued in federal
court that those arrests shouldn’t have counted against him because they had
been expunged.

Before working for the state prison system, McCraven worked for DCFS. During
his time with the child-welfare agency, he briefly was detailed to the IDOC
“intelligence and investigations division” between August and October 2011,
according to one of his job applications.

DCFS fired McCraven last year after the agency’s inspector general alleged he
was “writing and responding to hundreds of lewd and inappropriate emails”
while at work and falsified a DCFS job application.

McCraven filed a union grievance and sued to get his job back.

A federal judge dismissed his lawsuit in March but allowed him to amend it.
Instead, McCraven and his union struck a settlement with Quinn’s
administration. In June, McCraven dropped the grievance and accepted a 10-day
suspension, received six months’ back pay and was transferred to his current
job at corrections.

McCraven has made $1,700 in campaign contributions to elected officials
including former Gov. Rod Blagojevich; state Rep. Luis Arroyo (D-Chicago);
state Sen. William Delgado (D-Chicago); Cook County Commissioner Edwin Reyes
(D-Chicago), and U.S. Rep. Danny Davis (D-Ill.). In 2003, he was among
thousands of politically connected candidates listed in a then-secret database
of people seeking jobs, transfers or promotions in Blagojevich’s
administration, records show.

Three people were critically injured by a hit-and-run driver Sunday night on
the Northwest Side.

About 8:35 p.m., a vehicle headed west in the 2500 block of West Devon Avenue
hit three pedestrians, police said. The driver then crashed into a parked
vehicle and continued west on Devon.

One person was taken to Saint Francis Hospital in Evanston and the other two
were taken to Advocate Illinois Masonic Medical Center. All three were in
critical condition, police said.

Their ages and genders were not known, police said.

No one was in custody late Sunday. The Police Major Accidents Investigation
Unit was investigating.

A 4-year-old boy died after he was ejected from a car in a crash on the Dan
Ryan Expressway Sunday afternoon.

Four children and two adults were in a Ford Expedition in the northbound lanes
of the expressway near Eighth Street about 4:20 p.m. when the driver lost
control and the vehicle veered to the right and hit the guardrail, Illinois
State Police said.

Franklin Leon Jackson Jr., 4, was ejected from the vehicle and was taken to
Comer Children’s Hospital, where he was pronounced dead at 5:25 p.m.,
according to police and the Cook County Medical Examiner’s office.

The vehicle’s other occupants — a man, woman and three other children — all
declined medical treatment after the crash, state police said.

The cause of the crash remained under investigation Monday morning, state
police added.

December 26, 2013 (CHICAGO) (WLS) --  The Rev. Jesse Jackson says a lawsuit
will be filed against Cook County demanding changes in the way jail prisoners
are handled.

''It becomes a jail hotel, like a home shelter, and they [inmates] are being
held without a charge. Also, when they come to court, they spend more time in
jail, that is inhumane,'' Jackson said.

Jackson said he will make the case that those prisoners locked up for non-
violent charges should be released and put on a monitor and obtain job-skills
training.

r allegedly carjacking a woman in the North Side Edgewater neighborhood before h
e was foiled by Chicago police.

The 18-year-old woman was sitting in her vehicle about 10:13 p.m. Wednesday in
the 1100 block of West Ardmore Avenue when Broderick Epps, 18, allegedly
forced his way into the car and took control, implying that he had a gun,
according to a statement from the police office of News Affairs.

Epps then drove around the area and demanded money from the woman, who told
him she didn’t have any, police said.

A short time later, the victim’s fiance flagged down Foster District police
officers and told them that the woman had been compelled to call him and ask
him to bring cash to a predetermined location, police said.

The officers went to the specified location and saw Epps and the woman walking
north away from the parked vehicle, police said.

When he saw the officers, Epps tried to run away on foot, but was caught after
a brief foot chase and arrested in the 6400 block of North Sheridan Road,
police said.

Epps, of the 4200 block of Main Street in Skokie, was positively identified by
the victim and charged with felony counts of vehicular hijacking, vehicular
invasion and unlawful restraint, police said.

Epps was ordered held on $500,000 bond Thursday, and his next court date is
scheduled for Jan. 8, according to the Cook County Sheriff’s office.

January 27, 2014 (ORLAND PARK, Ill.) --  The Ohio woman charged in the
stabbing death of a Brother Rice High School business teacher waived
extradition back to Illinois on Monday.

Alisha M. Walker, 20, of Akron, Ohio, wearing a navy blue prison jumpsuit and
pink nail polish, said little during her hearing at the Allen County Criminal
Justice Center. Judge Robert Ross ordered Walker to continue being held
without bail in Allen County Jail on a first-degree murder warrant until her
next hearing Feb. 10.

Walker is accused of stabbing to death Alan Filan at his home in Orland Park.
Police said Walker has a history of prostitution and battery and that she
admitted to stabbing Filan.

By not fighting extradition, she eventually will be back in Cook County for
arraignment on the charge of first-degree murder. She will either be picked up
by Orland Park police officers or an extradition service will bring her back
to Cook County, the clerk said.

Police found Filan, 61, dead on his kitchen floor about 10:35 a.m. Tuesday
after being called to check on him when he didn't show up at work. He had been
stabbed multiple times, according to the Cook County medical examiner's
office.

""Walker confessed to being at the home of the victim on Jan. 18 after Filan
contacted her via the Internet site Backpage,"" according to the police.
""Walker and Filan argued over money, a struggle ensued, which resulted in
Walker stabbing Filan multiple times.""

Walker then drove off in her car, the police said. They said she previously
had seen Filan at least twice.

Brian Badke, Brother Rice's head football coach and a 1992 graduate, had Filan
for a typewriting teacher when he was a student at Rice.

""I am absolutely shocked. I was very surprised about everything. This is out
of character for him,"" Badke said. ""It is a shock to the faculty, staff and
administration. It will be a tough time for the kids who really liked Al. He
really cared about his kids. We will keep the Filan family in our prayers. We
will always remember Coach Filan. I was fortunate to have known him.""

Walker's mother, Sherri Chatman, of Akron, said her daughter told her she
acted in self-defense.

""Alisha told me she had to"" stab Filan, Chatman said Saturday, ""that there was
nothing else she could do. The only way I see my baby doing that is if she was
in danger, in harm. It was either him or her. I think she freaked out.""

Walker's uncle, Ed Hensley of Winchester, Ky., said he talked with his niece
Friday evening in a phone call from the Allen County Jail and that she told
him she and another woman, who also worked for an escort service, had gone to
Filan's home Jan. 18.

""They had some sort of two-for-one special and went over there,"" Hensley said.
""This guy got upset because it wasn't what the Internet suggested, or
whatever. My understanding is the guy wielded a knife at the other girl, and
then my niece freaked out, took the knife from him and then stabbed him with
it to keep [the other woman] from getting stabbed.""

Orland Park Police Comdr. John Keating comfirmed in an email Sunday, ""There
was another woman who traveled to the home with the suspect.""

The other woman is not a suspect, Keating said.

d the city and inspired renewed efforts to stop gun violence.

Hadiya Pendleton was the innocent victim of gang warfare. President Obama
mentioned her in his State of the Union address.

CBS 2′s Jim Williams talked to Hadiya's parents, who despite their grief have
been very busy in the past year. January 29th is an anniversary Cleo and Nate
Pendleton dread.

Cleo Pendleton, Hadiya's mother, called it ""the darkest day of our lives.""

""I don't look forward to the 29th at all,” said Hadiya's father, Nate
Pendleton.

“I'm afraid of the 29th because I remember what it felt like last year,” Cleo
said.

One year ago Wednesday, their daughter Hadiya was shot to death near her high
school. The 15-year-old honor student was the victim of alleged gang members
who fired into a crowd.

""We grieve always. Talking to you, we're grieving. Talking about our baby is
sad because it's in the past tense,” said Cleo Pendleton.

The Pendletons will mark the anniversary at an after-school assembly with
Hadiya’s classmates at King College Prep High School, which has been decked
out in purple – Hadiya’s favorite color.

Hadiya's murder, near President Obama's home a week after she performed at his
inauguration, galvanized the city. The Pendletons led efforts against gun
violence. Now the city just announced a 40 percent drop in youth violence last
year compared to 2012.

Overall murders also have dropped since Hadiya's death. Since she was killed
on Jan. 29, 2013, there have been 409 homicides in Chicago. During the same
period a year earlier (Jan. 29, 2012, through Jan. 28, 2013) there were 527
homicides. So in the year since Hadiya's death, Chicago's homicides have
dropped 22 percent.

The Pendletons said, a year after their daughter’s murder, they’re still
struggling to find a proper way to give meaning to Hadiya’s death. They
immersed themselves into the battle for new gun control laws, only to see them
fail in Congress.

They said they’re still working to put together a foundation aimed at helping
protect children from violence.

“It would be wonderful if the death of Hadiya had a ripple effect on
consciousness being raised in young people, and for them to make a different
choice on how to handle situations,” said Cleo Pendleton.

This last difficult year has taught the Pendletons how to console grieving
parents.

“There's no right thing to say,” said Cleo Pendleton. “People just being
present sometimes is enough.”

February 3, 2014 (CHICAGO) (WLS) --  An off-duty police officer fatally shot
an armed man in his 50s who was attempting to rob a Walgreens store Monday
morning in the Jefferson Park neighborhood on the Northwest Side, police said.

About 10:30 a.m., the suspect entered the Walgreens in the 5200 block of North
Milwaukee Avenue and announced a robbery, according to a statement from
Chicago police.

The officer had observed a ""frantic"" cashier stuffing money into a bag,
Fraternal Order of Police spokesman Pat Camden said. The officer's wife and
kids were waiting in a car in the parking lot. Camden said the officer ordered
the man, estimated at around 400 lbs., to kneel on the ground. After doing so,
Camden said, the suspect told the officer he would not be taken into custody
willingly, and the officer would have to shoot him. Camden said the suspect
then reached for a gun in his pocket, and the officer shot him.

The suspect was taken in serious-to-critical condition to Advocate Lutheran
General Hospital in Park Ridge, where he was pronounced dead hours later. No
one else was injured.

The robber's weapon was recovered at the scene, and charges were pending
Monday afternoon, police said.

Police suspect the robber may be responsible for several similar armed
robberies that have occured recently in the area, Camden said.

The Independent Police Review Authority is investigating the shooting.

__2014-02-03

Tensions are high as the 2014 Winter Olympics prepares to get underway
Thursday with figure skating and skiing events and then with the globally
televised opening ceremony Friday. While there is a tremendous amount of
anxiety over the possibility of a terrorist attack against the Games in Sochi,
Russia, there is also considerable uncertainty around who might protest the
country's new anti-gay laws and how and when they might do so. Beyond the
expectation that some might wear rainbow pins or hats that include ""P6,"" a
reference to the Olympic charter's non-discrimination policy, there are hints
of bands playing ""YMCA"" and one skater promising to ""rip"" into Russian
President Vladimir Putin after she's finished her competition.

There is even more uncertainty about what the Russian government will do to
anyone who does protest or violate its laws by expressing some positive
message about being gay.

In a conference call with reporters last week, the International Olympic
Committee president, Thomas Bach, said athletes would ""enjoy freedom of
speech"" at a press conference but they could be punished if they do so during
competition or on a medal podium. But a few days later, the chief executive of
the Olympic Games in Russia, Dmitry Chernyshenko, seemed to contradict that
statement.

""I don't think [athletes] are allowed by the [Olympic] Charter to express
those views that are not related to the sport at the press conference room,""
said Chernyshenko. ""What I would call the Sochi 'speakers' corner' has been
organized in Sochi city so that everybody can express themselves.""

The so-called ""speakers' corner"" is a cordoned off protest area six or seven
miles from the site of the Olympics.

[Outsports.com][1], a site devoted to news about LGBT athletes in both
professional and amateur sports, says it's found only six openly gay athletes
coming to the Sochi Olympics. All are women, none are American, and they
represent an ""an improbably low number"" among the 2,500 athletes coming to the
games.

The six include three speedskaters ( Canadian Anatasia Bucsis and Dutch Ireen
Wust and Sanne van Kerkhof ), two snowboarders ( Dutch Cheryl Maas and
Australian Belle Brockhoff ), and one Slovenian cross country skier ( Barbara
Jezerek ).

""Either GLBT athletes are uniquely bad at winter sports,"" wrote the Outsports,
""or dozens  perhaps a hundred or more must be competing in Sochi while in
the closet.""

By Sunday, the site announced a seventh openly gay competitor: Finnish Olympic
swimmer Ari-Pekka Liukkonen, who swims the men's 50-meter freestyle. Liukkonen
came out on Finnish television and said his family and teammates have taken
the news well.

For U.S. television audiences interested in watching the Olympics for signs of
LGBT demonstrations or visibility, there are two options: watch a condensed
broadcast of the events each evening on NBC, which is covering the events; or
watch live webstreams at [NBCOlympics.com][2], keeping in mind that Sochi is
nine hours ahead of U.S. east coast time.

The following is a list of specific events at which the potential for LGBT
visibility is higher than most:

Thursday, Feb. 6: Dutch lesbian Cheryl Maas will be competing in the ""Ladies
Slopestyle"" snowboarding event today. She has a profile video, Through My
Eyes, that talks about her wife and child. She has spoken in the Dutch press
about her unhappiness with the IOC choosing Russia for the Olympics given its
hostile laws.

Friday, Feb. 7: Two openly gay people are part of the United States' five-
member delegation to the opening ceremony, and there seems little doubt that
cameras will focus on them from time to time. They are tennis legend Billie
Jean King and Olympic figure skating medalist Brian Boitano. There are several
things to watch for during the opening ceremony: Do individual athletes wear
anything or do anything in the procession of athletes to identify themselves
as gay or as supporting equal treatment for gay people? Will Russian President
Vladimir Putin voice anything about the highly publicized controversy during
his remarks to the opening ceremony? And to what degree will NBC, which is
covering the Games globally, report on the controversy?

Saturday, Feb. 8: Speed skating starts today ( 6:30 a.m. ) and three openly
lesbian competitors are on the oval track. One of them, Canadian long-track
competitor Anatasia Bucsis, who told [outsports.com][3], ""I could never
promote that message of concealing who you are with all of this going on in
Russia. I'm kind of happy that I did it on my own terms."" The other two openly
lesbian speedskaters are both from the Netherlands, Ireen Wust ( short track )
and Sanne van Kerkhof ( 3000 relay ). Their presence on the track may be a
particularly interesting time to watch. The Washington Post reported that a
Dutch brass band Kleintje Pils ( ""Small Beer"" ) ""always performs at Olympic
speed skating ovals"" and signaled it might play the iconic gay anthem ""YMCA""
this year. ""We will see if we can get one or two songs into the selection,
knowing that in the Netherlands it will be seen as a signal we are thinking of
[gays],"" said Ruud Bakker, the band's leader.

Sunday, Feb. 16: The Women's Cross Snowboarding is today and Australian Belle
Brockhoff, the only openly gay person on Australia's Olympic team, has told
home country papers she plans to wear a ""P6"" logo and make her unhappiness
about the anti-gay laws in Russia known. ""The Australian Olympic Committee has
been really supportive and they want me to be safe. They don't recommend me
waving a [rainbow] flag around which I won't do,"" said Brockhoff, in an
interview published January 23 in the Courier-Mail.""The most I'll do is hold
up six fingers to represent Principle Six. Possibly I'll do it on camera here
or there, and maybe after the heats of my event."" After her event, Brockhoff
said she plans to speak freely about her thoughts. ""After I compete, I'm
willing to rip on his ass,"" she said. ""I'm not happy and there's a bunch of
other Olympians who are not happy either."" Also on the 16th, the Australian
Men's Bobsled team will carry ""Principle 6"" logo down the track on their two-
man bobsled. Team captain Heath Spence has spoken out against discrimination
of gay and lesbian athletes. He'll be competing in both two-man and four-man
sleds.

Sunday, Feb. 23: Closing Ceremony: The five-member delegation representing the
United States at the Closing Ceremony will include openly lesbian Olympic
silver medalist hockey player Caitlin Cahow. Any athlete who might want to
make a show of protest could save their plans for the closing ceremony so as
not to risk jeopardizing their competition and medals.

One of three men accused of fatally beating a 62-year-old man in an attack
that was recorded and posted on Facebook was sentenced to 27 years in prison
Tuesday after he admitted his role in the crime.

Cook County Judge Joseph Claps sentenced Nicholas Ayala to 20 years in prison
for Delfino “Don Valle” Mora’s murder.

Ayala, 18, of the 6300 block of North Talman Avenue, also received an
additional seven years in prison for the robbery tied to the July 10, 2012
incident.

Ayala and Anthony Malcolm used a cellphone to record video while their friend,
Malik Jones, allegedly punched Mora in the face in a West Rogers Park alley in
the 6300 block of North Artesian.

The teens were playing a game called “Pick ’em out and knock ’em down,” which
Assistant State’s Attorney Terry Clancy described in court as a “game where
the offender picks an innocent victim and knocks him out by striking him and
likely robbing him as well.”

Mora, a father of 12, was collecting empty cans when he was attacked about 5
a.m., the Sun-Times reported at the time. Mora, who lived in the 6000 block of
North Washtenaw, fell and hit the back of his head on the concrete.

The teens left him lying bleeding on the pavement, and Jones and Ayala
returned to take money from his wallet, prosecutors said. Mora was found
unconscious three hours later and taken to a hospital, where he died the next
day, authorities said.

The teens were arrested after the video was posted to Jones’ Facebook page.
Authorities also found the recording on his cellphone, prosecutors said.

Malcolm, 20, was convicted of first-degree murder and robbery, and is
currently serving a 30-year prison sentence.

Jones, now 18, is awaiting trial.

They were described as a triumvirate of drunken “goofs” and their alleged
ringleader, Brian Church, a “wayward confused man” who suffered “delusions of
protesting grandeur” and likened himself to a “ninja warrior.”

Now it’s up to a Cook County jury to determine whether Church, 22, Jared
Chase, 29, and Brent Betterly, 25, were something more Machiavellian and evil:
terrorists.

After a daylong session of closing arguments and a few hours of deliberations,
Judge Thaddeus Wilson sent jurors home late Thursday night. He asked them to
return Friday morning to resume deliberations in the controversial, high-
profile case that has generated debate on the First Amendment, police
entrapment and the heightened sense of fear after 9/11.

The three out-of-town activists weren’t merely spouting off their dislike for
police officers when they plotted to set cops on fire, Assistant State’s
Attorney Jack Blakey said in his closing arguments. They were gearing up for a
violent “wake-up call for a twisted anarchic revolution,” he said.

“Cold and calculating” was how Blakey’s colleague, Thomas Biesty, summarized
the NATO 3, who were secretly recorded by undercover Chicago Police officers
Nadia Chikko and Mehmet Uygun.

But the attorneys for the men warned jurors of the serious blunder of branding
their clients as terrorists and ripped into the credibility of Chikko and
Uygun. They said the undercover officers goaded the trio before their arrests
on May 16, 2012.

“I don’t like terrorists any more than you do, but it’s more important for me
as a Chicagoan not to overreact . . . not to call something terrorism that
isn’t terrorism because it’s convenient for our politicians,” said Thomas
Durkin, Chase’s attorney, citing “flimsy evidence.”

Michael Deutsch, who represents Church, said charging the three men with the
little-used state terrorism statute “trivializes” terrorism; “denigrates”
those who try to fight terrorism, and “disrespects real victims.”

“Is this what the war on terrorism has come to?” Betterly’s attorney Molly
Armour asked.

The men were unsophisticated and liked to “talk big” and exaggerate, their
attorneys said.

When Betterly boasted on Facebook that he was hoping for a “riot” in Chicago,
all he meant was that he was eager for a “large and loud protest,” Armour
said.

Durkin chastised prosecutors for showing jurors a long-distance picture of the
Chase Bank building that Church allegedly wanted to destroy, insinuating that
the state’s attorney’s office was hoping to evoke the Twin Towers.

The grizzled defense attorney also produced a slingshot that the men allegedly
wanted to use to break windows at President Barack Obama’s campaign
headquarters.

“Weapons of mass destruction,” Durkin sarcastically sneered. “Tools of
terrorism trade for sure.”

Armour said the crude Molotov cocktails the men allegedly constructed out of
beer bottles were merely a result of the men’s “hijinks.”

Blakey shot back, calling the firebombs an “arson machine.”

The prosecutor nicknamed Betterly “Professor Molotov” and gave Chase the
moniker “Captain Napalm.” Church, Blakey said, was “Mr. Cop on Fire.”

Blakey further disputed that the men were peaceful protesters or intoxicated
when they spoke of their alleged thwarted plans, which included throwing an
arrow into Mayor Rahm Emanuel’s home and attacking four police stations.

“How dare they crouch behind the legacy of nonviolent protest,” Blakey said.
“Martin Luther King? Gandhi? Mother Teresa? I don’t see them in court.”

Church, Chase and Betterly are charged with conspiracy to commit terrorism;
providing material support for terrorism; possession of an incendiary device;
and solicitation to commit arson.

The jury also has the option of finding the men guilty of mob action.

Late Thursday, jurors sent a note to Wilson, asking if manufacturing or
possessing an incendiary device is a felony or misdemeanor. They later asked
if the offense was a crime. Wilson told the jurors not to worry about possible
sentencing of the men and later clarified that manufacturing and possessing an
incendiary device with requisite intent is a felony offense.

26-year-old Angelique Kittell claimed through her attorney that she did not

 phony shooting threat to a west suburban high school on Friday to get back at h
im for a drug deal rip-off.

Nicholas J. Sikorski, 18, faces two felony counts of disorderly conduct for
allegedly calling in the false tip that another man was going to “shoot up”
Riverside Brookfield High School on Friday afternoon, according to Riverside
Police Chief Thomas Weitzel.

The school was put on a “soft lockdown” with no one allowed in or out of the
building without police escort after someone called in the anonymous tip at
1:32 p.m. Friday, close to dismissal time, Weitzel said.

The caller said there would be a shooting at the school and named the possible
shooter, police said.

Officers tracked down the named shooter- a former student who lives in
Maywood-and determined he hadn’t been part of the threat.

Facebook postings indicated that Sikorski and the man he named had a
disagreement over a drug rip-off, and when other police officers heard
recordings of the threat, they recognized Sikorski’s voice from past
encounters, Weitzel said.

Sikorski was arrested Friday night and later gave a full confession to setting
up the other man in retaliation for a drug rip-off that happened in the last
few weeks, police said.

“At no time was any student or staff member actually in immediate danger,”
Weitzel said.

Police said Sikorski, of the 3800 block of Blanchan Avenue in Brookfield, is a
former student who never graduated from the school.

Weitzel said extra police security was provided for Friday’s basketball games,
and that police would be at the school for drop-off Monday morning.

Riverside police will be seeking reimbursement for the cost of the Friday’s
response to the threat, which included numerous area police departments,
Weitzel said.

Sikorski’s bond was set at $75,000 on Saturday, and he is next scheduled to
appear in court in Maywood on Tuesday, according to the Cook County Sheriff’s
office.

February 25, 2014 (CHICAGO) (WLS) --  Face-to-face communication is the key to
cutting crime in some of city's most violent neighborhoods, Chicago police
say.

Under the department's custom notification program, a CPD commander finds out
who is likely to either cause trouble or be the victim of it and goes to their
home, sits down to talk, and lays out a choice. Choose to stay out of trouble,
and the community will help. If not, jail time could be longer than expected.

""My message is this is about the community wanting to end the violence,""
Chicago Police Commander Barbara West said. West is commander in the Austin
district where the intervention program started as a pilot six months ago.
Since then, she's knocked on the doors of 29 active gang members to talk.

""There've been times when I've not been received, the doors not opened -
slammed in my face, but there've been times when they actually invite me in to
sit at the table and talk about this with them, and have a conversation,""
Cmdr. West said.

""And we're making a concerted effort to have family members participate in
that conversation,"" Chicago Police Supt. Garry McCarthy said.

Police like what they're seeing thus far and are expanding their interventions
to active gang conflicts. Two weeks ago, after a 14-year old boy was killed on
the South Side in an apparent gang-related shooting, the commander of the
Grand Crossing district went to the homes of some gang leaders in the Woodlawn
neighborhood and warned them against escalating the conflict. In each
intervention, the commander is accompanied by a community partner who offers
the carrot - potential job contacts, housing needs, and maybe drug treatment.

""My gut tells me the community partners that we are working with are really
willing to provide these guys with help and services they need to change their
lifestyles,"" Commander West said.

Chicago police say there have been 60 of these interventions, and police say
to date, none has been involved in any new felony arrests; seventeen have
resulted in some form of social services assistance.

""It's early. It's early. And this is only preliminary stuff, but it's kind of
exciting,"" Supt. McCarthy said.

Critics refer to the interventions as Hug-A-Thug, but McCarthy said there is
no negotiation.

""It's not an enforcement strategy, it's an intervention,"" he said. ""I don't
care what people think. If it works, I will give them a hug myself.""

One of the targets of the custom notification program was killed in a gang-
related shooting weeks after police sought a meeting. Officials say he is the
one who slammed the door on Commander West.

March 11, 2014 (CHICAGO) (WLS) --  Police are looking for two gunmen who shot
and injured a retired police sergeant during a home invasion. Investigators
say the two men forced their way into the blind, former officer's home late
Monday night in the city's East Side community.

Investigators spent several hours Tuesday combing through the scene as they
tried to find anything that will lead them to the people who last night shot
retired Chicago Police Sergeant Elmer Brown during the course of a home
invasion.

""He's a very ill man. He's blind. He's been in a lot of medical conditions
he's had,"" said Eva Luna, caregiver.

Police say the intruders entered the home at 115th Street and Avenue G through
an unlocked door just before midnight, then asked the 73-year-old for the
location of the safe. They shot him in the neck when it wouldn't open, but his
wife was not harmed.

""I just think it's weird. This is a very quiet neighborhood. Nothing ever
happens here. There are four policemen on that block. There are six of them on
this side,"" said Rich Pina, neighbor.

""It's sick that someone would do something like that to someone elderly,"" said
Tim Wedrik, family friend.

In fact, police sources tell ABC7 they are looking into the possibility that
this was not a random crime, something also alluded to by 10th Ward Alderman
John Pope.

""It seems odd that these folks, including a retired police, had their home
broken into at midnight. Usually break-ins occur during the day when people
aren't at home,"" said Ald. Pope.

And while not an area with many break-ins, the neighborhood has recently seen
an uptick in con artists trying to gain access to people's homes, especially
those of the elderly.

""Especially with this cold weather. We've had a few people approach their
homes saying, I'm a city inspector, I'm with heating and cooling...I need to
get into your house to check your furnace, there is a water leak, so we remind
people not to take anyone's word for that,"" said Ald. Pope.

Brown was taken to Advocate Christ Medical Center in Oak Lawn, where he has
been upgraded from critical to serious condition. A bullet remains lodged in
his neck, and he is still sedated for now.

The investigation is ongoing and police do not yet have anyone in custody.

n no longer keep misconduct records secret.

The Illinois Freedom of Information Act doesn’t exempt “CR files,” which
consist of misconduct complaints against officers and documents created during
the investigations, the court found in a ruling Monday.

The appeals court also found that “RL” files are open to the public. Those
files identify police officers who have accumulated the most misconduct
complaints. At issue were two RL files that named officers with the most
complaints between 2001-06 and 2002-08.

University of Chicago law professor Craig Futterman hailed the ruling, saying:
“I really do think this is a watershed moment in Illinois in terms of police
transparency and accountability.”

Jamie Kalven, an independent journalist and community activist, filed a
Freedom of Information request asking CPD to provide him with the RL files as
well as CR files involving five officers, Futterman said.

In 2009, the U.S. 7th Circuit Court of Appeals ruled against Kalven because
the information he was seeking was part of a federal misconduct lawsuit. Third
parties like Kalven don’t have legal standing to become involved in a suit
once the plaintiff and defendant settle and agree to seal the police
misconduct files, the federal appeals court ruled.

But the state appeals court said those files are a matter of public record
under the state Freedom of Information Act.

The state appeals court returned Kalven’s request to a lower court to decide
what information the police department can black out from the CR and RL files
because of privacy concerns.

Futterman said he doesn’t have a problem with the department redacting
personal information about officers and third parties — such as telephone
numbers, Social Security numbers and the like.

He also doesn’t have a problem with the department blacking out the names of
the people who file the complaints and witnesses who are interviewed during
the investigations.

But he said Kalven should oppose any attempt by the department to block the
public from seeing recommendations by the police Internal Affairs Bureau and
the Independent Police Review Authority — the bodies that investigate
complaints of police misconduct — about how much discipline should be imposed
against officers for sustained complaints.

Futterman added that the appeals court clearly stated that the names of the
officers and the allegations of misconduct can’t be redacted.

“Police officers do not have recognized privacy interests in complaints of
misconduct,” Futterman said. “We entrust cops with a lot of power — power to
use force and even to shoot and kill. They have to have that power to do their
jobs. But with that power comes responsibility. … This will allow the public
to evaluate whether the process of these complaints being investigated is a
good process that we can trust in.”

The court battle over the records stems from a 2004 lawsuit that Diane Bond
filed against Chicago Police claiming she was abused by officers. Futterman
was her attorney and submitted evidence that less than 1 percent of misconduct
investigations resulted in a complaint being sustained.

Bond settled her suit for $150,000, records show.

Shannon Breymaier, a spokeswoman for the city’s Law Department, said the city
plans to appeal the decision to the Illinois Supreme Court.

March 29, 2014 (CHICAGO) (WLS) --  Residents scuffle with officers as tensions
run high in a South Side neighborhood after a man is shot and killed by
Chicago Police.

Police say that the shooting happened as they interrupted a drug deal that was
taking place in the neighborhood. The subsequent investigation forced them to
close a five-block stretch of the area, even as a large crowd gathered to
protest the shooting.

It was shortly before 9 Saturday morning, when police say two officers
observed a hand-to-hand drug exchange taking place on the 6200 block of South
Eberhardt.

It was, they say, during the subsequent foot chase, they noticed 20-year-old
Raason Shaw clutching an object in his waistband. They chased him through
gangways all the way to 67th and Rhodes and that is when they say he pulled a
gun on them.

""As he jumps the fence he has a 40-caliber glock with an extended clip in his
hand,"" said Pat Camden, Fraternal Order of Police. ""He goes over the fence.
Sees the officer coming at him, raises the weapon towards the officer, the
officer fires.""

Shaw was dead on the scene. And police say a glock semi-automatic handgun with
a laser sight and extended high capacity magazine was recovered, but family
and friends who witnessed the shooting, insist that's not true.

""The police pulled a gun like he was going to shoot him too, telling him to
back up,"" said Veronique Jones, the victim's cousin. ""He was just laying
there. He didn't have no weapon or nothing. He was just trying to hop a gate.""

""He never posed a threat or anything,"" said friend Jay White. ""He had a
warrant of his arrest that he knew of...so maybe that's why he took off
running.""

The incident drew a large crowd of people into the streets, a lot of them
angry at what they viewed as an unprovoked shooting, openly confronted police.
At least three people were led away in handcuffs.

""I got a call from my daughter. She was screaming and hollering. My son was
going up to his cousin's house and the next thing I know he's running through
the alley and the police shot him,"" said Sharon Shaw, the victim's mother.

Among those who were drawn out by the shooting was Shaw's boss. She says the
20-year-old had a criminal history, but now worked for her, cleaning out
foreclosed homes.

""He was a kid,"" said Shamika Jordan. ""He had a troubled past, but he was
trying to get his life together. He had started working. Comes to work every
day on time. I had no complaints about him.""

Shaw was wanted on a warrant for missing a court appearance for a misdemeanor
criminal trespass charge. As with all police-involved shootings, it is now the
Independent Police Review Authority that is in charge of the investigation.

A convicted sex offender was ordered held without bond Wednesday, accused of
raping a University of Illinois at Chicago student in a dormitory room shower
on the Near West Side campus earlier this week.

Tavares Humphries got into the Commons South residence hall by following a
student inside, then burglarized a co-eds’ dorm room before attacking the 18
-year-old woman Monday morning, Cook County prosecutors said.

The woman, who was taking a shower, pulled back her shower curtain to see a
naked Humphries asking for soap, Assistant State’s Attorney Pierina Infelise
said.

The student yelled at Humphries, 28, and told him to leave but he kept asking
for soap, Infelise said. Humphries continued to take a shower in the stall
directly across from the woman before entering her shower, Infelise said.

The woman ordered Humphries to leave and he allegedly complied but stayed in
the bathroom. Moments later, he lunged at the woman and choked her, rendering
her unconscious, Infelise said.

When the woman woke up, she was in a different stall, and Humphries was
sexually assaulting her, Infelise said. The student screamed but Humphries
allegedly slapped her and told her to “shut up.”

Humphries wrapped his hands around the woman’s neck and again rendered her
unconscious, Infelise said.

Two students heard the woman’s screams and one detained Humphries until police
arrived at the dorm, in the 700 block of South Halsted Street, Infelise said.

The victim suffered multiple abrasions to her face, shoulder and back,
swelling to her knee and lacerations to her genitals, Infelise said.

She and a witness who heard her screams identified Humphries in a line-up,
prosecutors said.

When Humphries was being questioned by UIC police, he lunged at a detective,
Infelise said. He also allegedly squeezed the officer’s groin when the officer
tried to place handcuffs on him.

Humphries, of the 3300 block of West Lexington, has been charged with
attempted murder, aggravated criminal sexual assault, aggravated kidnapping,
battery of a peace officer and residential burglary.

He had to register as a sex offender after he was deemed delinquent for an
aggravated criminal sexual assault in 2001. His rap sheet includes four felony
convictions on drug charges and failing to register as a sex offender.

__2014-04-10

_

  
For all practical purposes, ""Nocturnal Wonderland,"" to be held May 16, from
7-10 p.m. at Edwin G. Foreman High School, 3235 N. Leclaire Ave., will be like
a typical prom, according to Ryan Dolan, who teaches Freshman English at the
school and is helping organize the event.

""There's a place to take pictures, catered food, a dance floor, a DJ and
decorations,"" said Dolan. ""There will be a drag queen performances, tooI
guess that's the only place where it will deviate from a normal prom.""

""Nocturnal Wonderland,"" which is sponsored by the Chicago Public Schools Gay-
Straight Alliance Clubs, is the third annual LGBT prom for students.

Dolan added that the school is ""buzzing"" in anticipation of the event, which
will be emceed by performer Precious Jewels.

Dolan said about 250 CPS students are expected to attend. That's about 50 more
than attended last year, which, in turn, is 50 more than the year before that.
In previous years the prom had been held at Power House High and Lane
Technical College Prep High. The event is fully sanctioned by CPS, and there
has been virtually no opposition to the prom this year, according to Dolan.
""If there has been any, I haven't heard about it, and want to steer clear of
it.""

After chaperoning last year's LGBT prom, Dolan ""almost never wants to be at a
'straight' prom again. People had made all these assumptions that if you
gathered all these kids in one spot, they would be behaving badly all night
long. But it was the most wholesome and awesome prom you can imagine. For many
of them, it was their first time in a queer space, and they were so happy
because of it.""

Tickets are available for purchase online at [chicagogsaprom.bpt.me][1].

160490,G,http://wgntv.com/2014/04/15/preist-accused-of-sexual-misconduct-cleared-resumes-role-at-church/,,Missing,"A priest accused of sexual misconduct will be reinstated this week after an
investigation cleared him of any wrongdoing.

57-year-old Father Michael W. O’Connell, pastor of St. Alphonsus Church in
Chicago’s Lakeview neighborhood, will be reinstated after a four and a half
month investigation into sexual misconduct allegations.

The allegations came from a man, now in his 20′s, who accused Father Mike of
molesting him when he was in grade school at Our Lady of the Woods in Orland
Park in 1990. He says Father Mike sexually assaulted him in CCD.

“I've never done anything inappropriate with a young person,” O’Connell said
today after a Mass in which Francis Cardinal George made a public statement as
Rev. O'Connell stood with him on the alter.

Fr. Mike says he never met his accuser and wishes him only peace and blessings
in his life. He said he cooperated fully with the investigation.

“I trusted that justice would be done that the process would work that the
truth would come out,” he said.

Besides the archdiocese, the Cook County Sheriff's police and state's
attorney's office also investigated.   They issued this statement saying they
thoroughly investigated the allegation and were unable to support any charges.

Barbara Blaine from the Survivors Network of those Abused by Priests met with
the alleged victim and believes him. SNAP is against reinstating Father Mike
and believes there are others who will come forward now with similar
allegations.

“What we have is insufficient evidence to bring charges. They are not saying
the victim is not credible,” Blaine said.

Blaine says she is very leery of Cardinal George's actions concerning accused
priests in the past and says people should continue to be cautious.

drug case and the man arrested in the case has filed a federal civil rights
lawsuit.

In what has been called a ""Perry Mason""  moment, a videotape played in court
contradicted what three Chicago and two Glenview police officers had just said
on the stand.  The judge was outraged and called it a conspiracy.

23-year-old Joe Sperling’s arrest in Glenview was recorded last june.  Police
said they stopped him because he didn't use his turn signal properly.
Sperling had been under surveillance by Chicago narcotics officers who asked
Glenview for assistance.  All five police officers told the court the same
story: that they followed proper procedure in arresting Sperling and
confiscating a pound of pot from his car.

But the video showed otherwise. It showed procedures weren't followed and
Sperling was arrested

Without the videotape, Sperling was likely headed to jail after several drug
arrests and a 2010 drug conviction.  But charges were dismissed.

The five officers were stripped of their police powers and placed on desk duty
pending internal investigations.  They could also face perjury charges and
possibly lose their jobs.

the Yards neighborhood, and a social-media feud may have played a role in the ki
lling.

Endia Martin, a Tilden High School student, was with another teen girl in the
900 block of West Garfield Avenue when they were hit by gunfire around 4:30
p.m.

Martin was taken to Comer’s Children Hospital, where she was pronounced dead,
according to the Chicago Fire Department.

The other girl was in stable condition at St. Bernard's Hospital.

Kent Kennedy, Martin's stepfather, said Endia was coming home from school when
a student from a different school approached her.

""They had words, and she gunned our daughter down, in the back -- for what?""
Kennedy tells CBS 2. ""For what reason?""

It appears the incident may have been triggered by insults exchanged on a
social-media website.

""This feud on social media needs to stop,"" says community activist Andrew
Holmes. ""It gets ugly, and eventually, sometimes, as you see, one has lost
their life.""

A source says a person of interest is in police custody.

 Saturday after she allegedly stole at least $1,400 from a coworker’s ballpark r
egister.

Porsha Summeries, 21, of the 3500 block of South Dearborn Street, was charged
with one felony count of theft after she allegedly admitted to stealing the
money, the Chicago Sun-Times is reporting.

Cook County prosecutors said she repeatedly stole cash Friday afternoon from
another cashier’s drawer — unbeknownst to her coworker — then gave at least
$200 to another employee.

Management at Levy Restaurants, which serves food at Wrigley Field, noticed
money missing from the register and confronted Summeries and the other
employee Friday evening, prosecutors said.

Summeries allegedly then signed a statement admitting she took the money, at
which point management called the police. She returned $1,255, prosecutors
said.

Summeries did not speak with police at the time of her arrest, prosecutors
told Judge Laura Marie Sullivan.

U.S. Attorney Zach Fardon called on Chicago’s business leaders to join the
fight against gang violence Wednesday as he unveiled a program to intervene in
troubled youths’ lives.

Calling the murders of black teens on the South and West sides “a social
justice problem,” Fardon asked downtown executives to “own this problem”
during a lunchtime speech to the City Club of Chicago.

“It’s my problem, it’s your problem, it’s our problem,” he said.

The speech was Fardon’s most detailed account since his appointment seven
months ago of his philosophy for tackling street crime.

Strong on rhetoric — he showed City Club members photos of 13 black children
killed in the city so far this year, said 700 under-18s have been murdered
here since 2007 and repeated his mantra that “we cannot arrest our way out of
this gang problem” — the speech contained little in the way of new
initiatives.

But Fardon said a $500,000 Department of Justice grant is funding “Youth
Outreach Forums” in the Englewood and Harrison police districts as of last
week. The forums are modeled on successful programs for adult parolees and
attempt to connect troubled teens with law enforcement, non-profit and social
services and “give them alternatives” to the gang lifestyle, Fardon said.

Fardon also urged the business community to offer their time and money to non-
profit groups that take on gang violence.

“These are not war zones — these neighborhoods are not separate and discrete
from our city, they are our city,” he said.

“I’m asking that each of you think about how you can own this problem.”

Fardon has been under political pressure from Senators Mark Kirk and Dick
Durbin and Mayor Rahm Emanuel to do more to tackle street violence, but has
consistently refused to make it a higher priority than political corruption,
for which his office is better known.

On Wednesday he said the fracturing in recent years of hierarchical gang
structures and increased incidence of shootings over social media insults and
other petty slights made prosecutors’ job harder.

Tackling the issue was “a generational challenge,” he said.

Three people were killed and at least 20 others have been wounded in shootings
across the city since Friday evening.

The most recent fatal shooting happened Saturday night on the city’s West
Side.

Kennyone Pendelton, 36, was shot multiple times in the chest about 9:25 p.m.
in the 4600 block of West Jackson Boulevard, according to police and the Cook
County Medical Examiner’s office.

Pendelton, of the 1100 block of North Lawler Avenue, was pronounced dead at
the scene at 9:36 p.m., according to the medical examiner’s office.

Police said the shooting may be gang-related.

About 1:30 a.m. Saturday, officers responding to a call of shots fired in the
5600 block of South Wabash Avenue found 18-year-old Brian Weekly and a 20
-year-old man, both of whom had suffered multiple gunshot wounds and were
unresponsive in an alley, according to police and the Cook County Medical
Examiner’s office.

Weekly, of the 1400 block of West 79th Street, was dead at the scene,
authorities said. The 20-year-old was taken to John H. Stroger Jr. Hospital of
Cook County in critical condition, police said.

Friday night, a 22-year-old woman was shot to death in the West Garfield Park
neighborhood.

Carnesha Fort was shot multiple times about 10:45 p.m. near her home in the
100 block of North Keeler Avenue, authorities said.

She was taken to Mount Sinai Hospital, where she died at 11:25 p.m.,
authorities said. Police said the shooting may have been domestic-related.

The most recent non-fatal shooting happened Sunday night in Roseland on the
Far South Side.

About 7:20 p.m., a 25-year-old man was shot in both legs in the 10200 block of
South State Street, police said. He was taken to Advocate Christ Medical
Center in Oak Lawn in “stable” condition.

At least 18 others have been wounded in shootings across the city since Friday
night.

Additionally, two Chicago Police officers were among four people wounded in a
shooting during a traffic stop about 11:25 p.m. Friday on the South Side.

The officers were conducting a traffic stop in the 9300 block of South Wallace
Street when a man fired shots at them from the vehicle’s passenger seat,
authorities said. The officers shot the man multiple times and shot the woman
who had been driving the vehicle once in the shoulder, police said.

One officer, 38, was shot in his knee, and the other, 31, was struck in his
bulletproof vest, but it did not pierce his skin, police said.

The man shot by police was taken in critical condition to Advocate Christ
Medical Center, where he underwent surgery early Saturday. The officer shot in
his knee was in good condition, also at Advocate Christ Medical Center, and
the officer struck in his vest was treated and released with a deep bruise to
his chest.

The woman was treated for a graze wound at Little Company of Mary Hospital and
Health Care Centers in Evergreen Park and later released to police custody,
authorities said.

A Far South Side man was ordered held in lieu of $300,000 bail Thursday for
allegedly stalking his ex-wife, a Chicago Police sergeant.

Eric Terry, 39, slashed his ex-wife’s friends’ car tires and harassed her
while she was at her home with her two children this summer, Cook County
prosecutors said.

Terry’s ex-wife has an active order of protection against him. The couple
divorced in September 2013, Assistant State’s Attorney Erin Antonietti said.

Terry was acquitted in April on similar charges involving the same victim,
authorities said.

When he was arrested on Tuesday, Terry, allegedly said, “This s--- better not
be about that bitch.”

Terry, of the 1200 block of West 122th Place, was charged with aggravated
stalking and criminal damage to property after a series of events he was
suspected to be involved in, prosecutors said.

At least twice, in May and June, a friend noticed that her car tires had been
slashed after leaving the officer’s house, in the 8200 block of South Whipple
Street, Antonietti said.

Terry allegedly slashed the tires of the victim’s other friend in mid July. A
neighbor of that friend had seen Terry in the area before the friend’s car was
vandalized in the 7900 block of South California Avenue, Antonietti said.

A few days before on July 9, the victim and a friend were sitting on her porch
when a glass bottle was thrown at them and smashed on the ground, Antonietti
said.

The victim also allegedly received a phone call from a man she recognized as
Terry, telling her, “You know you’re dead bitch, wait ‘til I catch your ass.”

Terry also was caught on the victim’s home surveillance camera breaking the
lens with a hammer on July 23, Antonietti said.

The surveillance camera picked up Terry driving his Maroon Monte Carlo in his
ex-wife’s neighborhood three to four times this month, Antonietti said.

Terry, a father of three, has a master’s degree in public administration, an
assistant public defender said.

A lawsuit was filed Tuesday in federal court against Chicago Police Cmdr.
Glenn Evans, who prosecutors allege stuck his gun in a suspect’s mouth, held a
Taser to his groin and threatened to kill him after a foot chase on the South
Side in January 2013.

In August, Evans was relieved of his police powers and charged with official
misconduct and aggravated battery in connection with the incident. He was
released without bond.

The plaintiff, Rickey Williams, claims the incident started at a bus stop near
the corner of 71st and Eberhart on Jan. 30, 2013. Evans pulled up in his squad
car and stared at Williams for several minutes, making Williams “nervous and
scared,” the suit stated.

Williams ran into an abandoned home on Eberhart. Evans and several other
officers chased him into the home. While one officer had his knee on Williams’
torso and his hand on his neck, Evans “began to coercively interrogate and
torture” Williams inside the home, the suit claims.

The suit claims Evans put a Taser or stun gun to Williams’ groin area,
demanding to know where he “put the guns.”

Evans then jammed the barrel of his service revolver deep into Williams’
mouth, touching his throat, and said, “I should kill you right now,” the suit
claims.

No gun was ever recovered. Williams, 24, was charged with reckless conduct,
but the charge was dropped when the officers failed to appear in court.

The City of Chicago was also named as a defendant. John Holden, a spokesman
for the city’s Law Department, said the city has not had an opportunity to
review the specific allegations and was not able to comment Tuesday afternoon.
Evans’ attorney, Laura Morask, could not be reached for comment Tuesday night.

The day after he was arrested, Williams filed a complaint with the Independent
Police Review Authority.

Evans turned over his gun for testing and Williams submitted a DNA sample. In
April 2014, testing conducted by the Illinois State Police found a match
between DNA on Evans’ gun and Williams, nearly a year after the samples were
submitted.

After the DNA test, IPRA recommended that Chicago Police Supt. Garry McCarthy
strip Evans of his police powers, the suit stated.

The suit blames McCarthy and Mayor Rahm Emanuel for allowing Evans to remain
in his post as commander despite IPRA’s recommendation.

The “City of Chicago has a well-settled, widespread ‘code of silence’ that
exists within the Chicago Police Department whereby officers conceal each
other’s misconduct in the contravention of their sworn duties,” the suit
stated.

The five-count suit seeks an undisclosed amount in damages.

192909,L,http://chicago.cbslocal.com/2014/12/31/uber-driver-charged-with-rape-was-using-wifes-account/,,Uber Driver Charged With Rape Was Using Wife’s Account,"**CHICAGO (AP) -** A Chicago driver accused of sexually assaulting an Uber passe
nger was not authorized to drive for the ride-sharing company and used an accoun
t created in his wife's name to pick up customers, the company said Wednesday.

San Francisco-based Uber has come under scrutiny over its driver screening
process, including from prosecutors in California who filed a lawsuit in
December accusing Uber of exaggerating how comprehensive its background checks
are.

Uber said Maxime Fohounhedo was driving under an account created in his wife's
name in violation of Uber's rules prohibiting account sharing. Prosecutors say
he used his own photo and phone number on the account.

Uber spokeswoman Jennifer Mullin couldn't immediately explain how that
discrepancy could have been missed during the application process or despite
what she said were Uber's ""regular re-checks"" of driver photos.

""We do our best to send drivers though our background check process, which far
exceeds what's expected of taxis,"" she said. ""But there is also a
responsibility for the rider to make sure that when they get into an Uber that
they're checking the license plate and they're checking the driver's face and
making sure all that matches up.""

In this case, though, such scrutiny by the rider might not have helped because
Fohounhedo's own photo would have showed up on the user's smartphone, Mullin
acknowledged.

The Uber app allows smartphone users to search for rides from regular taxis,
limos and private individuals such as Fohounhedo who use their own vehicles in
an arrangement known as ride-sharing.

Fohounhedo was arrested Sunday and has been charged with sexual assault in an
alleged attack in November. A judge ordered him held Tuesday in lieu of
$500,000 bail.

The 22-year-old victim told police she was attacked between 3 a.m. and 4 a.m.
after being picked up from a bar.

Assistant State's Attorney Robert Mack said the woman was intoxicated and woke
up on a couch at the driver's apartment with the man sexually assaulting her.
Afterward, he told the victim, ""I made you happy,"" Mack said.

Public defender Sandra Bennewitz told reporters Fohounhedo ""has evidence that
will support his claim that he did not do this and that whatever happened was
consensual.""

Fohounhedo would not have been eligible to drive for Uber in Chicago, where
regulations require ride-share applicants to have held a license for at least
a year. Fohounhedo has only held a temporary Illinois visitor driver's license
since August, according to the Illinois Secretary of State's office. His wife,
however, has had a regular Illinois license since 2009.

Uber says its background checks screen would-be drivers against county,
federal and multi-state records going back seven years.

It also cites records showing several hundred physical violence complaints
against traditional taxi drivers in recent years in Chicago.

A public records search by The Associated Press found no evidence of a prior
criminal record for Fohounhedo.

200859,Z,http://www.wbez.org/news/aclu-chicago-police-make-more-stops-new-york-its-peak-111751,,ACLU: Chicago police make more stops than New York at its peak,"Chicago police officers initiated stop, question and frisk encounters at a
much higher rate last summer than their New York City counterparts ever did,
according to a civil liberties group.

The American Civil Liberties Union of Illinois released a [report][1] Monday
saying it identified more than 250,000 Chicago stop-and-frisk encounters in
which there were no arrests from May through August 2014.

And just like the former controversial New York practice, the ACLU alleges
African Americans and other racial minorities in Chicago were
disproportionately targeted for police stops.

The trouble with Chicago cops' contact cards

Encounters with Chicago police officers often begin with a form called a
contact card. Previously, the card was used to log everything from a voluntary
conversation with a citizen to an involuntary stop of someone deemed
suspicious. When police deem it necessary, that stop can result in a frisk, or
pat down, too. That catch-all policy was [revised][2] in January to require
contact cards only when the police interaction is an ""investigatory stop,"" or
relating to ""enforcement of the Gang and Narcotics-Related Loitering
Ordinances"" and not for all citizen encounters.

In New York, when a stop included a frisk, it was [clearly documented][3];
when a subsequent arrest was made, it too was noted on the contact card.
That's not always the case in Chicago. In fact, if an arrest is made, a
contact card is not required.

> **Related: [Poorly designed police work means the public is in the dark
about stop and frisk in Chicago][4]**

While the contact card is used for so much police work, the details they
contain can be unruly - and documentation of them near impossible for the
public to obtain in volume. Where NYPD cards have easy-to-read,
straightforward fields, Chicago's system relies on a police officer's
communication skills: the pertinent information is to be transcribed in the
police narrative section of the form.

The variance in Chicago's record keeping has made it especially difficult to
track the frequency and effectiveness of stop and frisk here. And it makes
direct comparison to New York City, at this point, flawed.

Who gets stopped by Chicago cops?

African-Americans accounted for nearly three-quarters of those stopped last
summer, according to the ACLU, even though they make up about a third of the
city's population.

On a per capita basis, Chicago police stopped 93.6 people per 1,000 residents,
or more than four times New York's peak rate of 22.9 stops per 1,000
residents, which happened during the same four-month period of 2011.

""The Chicago Police Department stops a shocking number of innocent people,""
said Harvey Grossman, the ACLU's legal director. ""And just like New York, we
see that African Americans are singled out for these searches.""

People were far more likely to be stopped in predominantly black communities
and blacks were more likely to be the target of stops in predominantly white
neighborhoods, the study found.

For example, African-Americans accounted for 15 percent of the stops in the
Jefferson Park area, even though they made up just 1 percent of its
population.

The ACLU said it also found that police gave no ""legally sufficient reason""
for initiating many of the stops.

On about half the cards, the officers didn't state a reason for the stop, and
in some cases, they stated that they stopped someone for a reason that wasn't
related to suspected criminal activity.

Grossman said the information that was on the cards was woefully inadequate,
and the cards didn't indicate that a person had been frisked, which the ACLU
researchers can only assume happened.

And, Grossman said, many of the people who've been stopped say the experience
was far from casual.

""They are serious events to people and they form your view of the police,""
Grossman explained. ""You no longer think of police as Officer Joe Friendly
anymore after you get stopped and have someone shove their hands down your
pockets.""

In a statement, Chicago Police Supt. Garry McCarthy said the department's
chief goal is to ensure that ""everyone in every neighborhood enjoys the same
sense of safety, and the best way to achieve that goal is working with the
communities we serve.""

McCarthy added that people should only be stopped based on crime data and
crime information, ""nothing else.""

But the use of contact cards has dramatically increased since Supt. McCarthy
started running the department in 2011.

Police say contact cards are key crime-fighting tool

The department, which has reported a significant drop in crime around the city
in recent years, has made it clear that the cards are a key component of its
crime-fighting strategy; that the information is crucial to track gang members
and in making arrests.

Late last year, prosecutors said information from contact cards showed that
two days before the 2013 shooting death of a high school honor student, Hadiya
Pendleton, the two suspects were in the white Nissan that served as the
getaway car.

Grossman said he's not surprised that the department relies so heavily on the
stop-and-frisk policy. The superintendent spent the bulk of his career in the
NYPD and he was the police chief in Newark, New Jersey, before coming to
Chicago in 2011.

The policy has come under fire in both East Coast cities.

In New York, a federal judge determined the NYPD policy was sometimes
discriminating against minorities and found the practice to be
unconstitutional.

And in Newark, the department was placed under a federal monitor after the
U.S. Department of Justice found that during a period that included McCarthy's
time running the department, 75 percent of pedestrian stops were made without
constitutionally adequate reasons and in the city where blacks make up 54
percent of the population, they accounted for 85 percent of those stops.

""There is no question the superintendent endorses stop and frisk...It is part
of the fabric of McCarthy's policing,"" Grossman told reporters Monday.

In an email, a CPD spokesman Martin Maloney pointed out that the demographic
breakdown of contact cards issued closely mirrors the data in the department's
case reports. (Those are descriptions of suspects identified by a third party,
which is documented within incident reports.)

![][5]

The same spokesman said the department has added new levels of supervision and
accountability with respect to its use of contact cards. Adding that officers
are now required to ""document more details explaining why a contact card was
issued.""

204511,C,http://www.beachwoodreporter.com/column/the_wednesday_papers_461.php,,The [Wednesday] Papers,"""Mayor Rahm Emanuel on Tuesday declined to say whether he agreed with Chicago
police Superintendent Garry McCarthy's assertion that an off-duty detective
should not have faced criminal charges in the 2012 fatal shooting of a woman,""
the _Tribune_ [reports][1].

Tough choices.

""The mayor also did not say whether he backed McCarthy's comment that the
victim 'also happened' to be hit by Detective Dante Servin's gunfire as the
off-duty cop 'hit the individual who he was aiming at.'""

Okay, this would be [the Rekia Boyd case][2]. Servin ostensibly fired five
shots at Antonio Cross, who was either two feet away (according to the
defense) or 40 feet away (according to prosecutors and, presumably, the
police), and struck Cross in the hand with one, missed with three, and struck
Boyd in the back of the head either 30 or 40 feet away.

""Emanuel faced the questions a day after McCarthy discussed the Servin case.
Prosecutors charged Servin with involuntary manslaughter, alleging the officer
acted recklessly when he fired five shots over his shoulder from inside his
Mercedes in the direction of four people who had their backs to him in a dark
West Side alley in March 2012.""

I'm not sure whether Servin allegedly shot over his shoulder or across his
body as he sat in his car; also, I'm not sure Cross had his back to him. But
let's go on.

""Last week, a judge ruled the manslaughter charge did not apply because
prosecutors failed to prove Servin acted recklessly since he pointed a gun at
an intended victim and fired. The only proper charge, the judge ruled, would
have been murder.

""Asked Monday about the judge's ruling based on a legal technicality, McCarthy
said the officer never should have been charged in the first place, but
declined to say why.""

I think we can presume McCarthy believes Servin was acting in self-defense. It
would be interesting to ask McCarthy if he believes, as Servin still does,
that Cross had a gun, even though police were unable to find a shred of
evidence that a gun existed. It would also be interesting to ask McCarthy how
police are trained to handle the situation Servin found himself in - from
calling 911 to complain about a noisy congregation of kids to the argument in
the alley to firing the shots from his car.

Or, more like, it would be interesting to hear McCarthy _answer_ those
questions. In fact, it would be more than interesting; _it's McCarthy's duty
to answer._

Not doing so makes his ""listening tour"" even more of a mockery than it already
is; a listening tour is also about responding to the public's concerns, not
just listening to their questions and walking away as if the mission has been
accomplished.

> ""It's something that should not have happened. Absolutely, positively not,""
McCarthy said Monday.

If it's something that absolutely, positively should not have happened, and
the result was a dead woman, it's hard to see how charges should not have been
filed.

Square that circle, Mac.

> McCarthy also said prosecutors' decision to charge Servin created a ""safety
hazard,"" arguing that ""every single officer who's out there now might be in a
position where they hesitate, and as a result, they could lose their lives.""

To a cell phone?

I'd say the safety hazard is on us citizens; Servin was the first Chicago cop
charged in a killing in 20 years and he walked. I don't know why any police
officer around here would feel the need to hesitate.

""On Tuesday, Emanuel was asked if he agreed with McCarthy's insistence that
Servin should never have been charged and whether he believed his top cop's
comments about the officer hitting his target were appropriate given the fact
that an innocent woman died. The mayor did not directly answer the question,
citing an ongoing Independent Police Review Authority evaluation of the case.

> ""Right now, you know that situation is being looked at by IPRA,"" Emanuel
said. ""So, I'm not going to comment on that.""

That would be fair if Rahm's point was to wait for the facts. But the shooting
happened in 2012 and it's not likely that IPRA is going to dig up new
information missed by the Chicago Police Department and the Cook County
State's Attorney's Office in their zeal to protect one of their own. If
exculpatory evidence existed, they'd be the first to have found it.

Still, a good question then would be if the mayor thought it was appropriate
that McCarthy spoke before the IPRA review was finished.

""Instead, the mayor chose to focus on McCarthy's recently launched 'listening
tour.' The mayor said the idea is for McCarthy and his top district commanders
to strengthen their ties in the community by talking with 'religious leaders
and community leaders' in their neighborhoods.""

So a dog-and-pony show with selected ""leaders"" already in Rahm's camp.

""Emanuel, though, bristled when asked why such an effort was necessary when
McCarthy had been running the department for the last four years.

> ""The question is not a fair question,"" Emanuel responded. ""It's building on
the introduction, four years ago, of community policing.""

How is that not a fair question? It's taken McCarthy four years to listen!

Plus: Community policing was not introduced just four years ago. Rahm always
thinks everything began and ends with him. It's like [no one knew there were
even coal plants in the city before Rahm took office][3]!

And: What Rahm is doing isn't community policing. Not even close.

""Chicago Police Department leaders long have engaged in concepts they've
_described_ as community policing, far pre-dating the Emanuel administration.
The department's Chicago Alternative Policing Strategy, or CAPS, community
policing program started in 1992.""

Italics mine, because this is correct: Chicago has never really engaged in
community policing.

""The discussion on Chicago's police practices comes as Baltimore endured
violent riots this week after the funeral of Freddie Gray, a 25-year-old
African-American man who died in police custody there. A reporter asked
Emanuel on Tuesday whether he had watched the coverage of the Baltimore police
protests and if he worried about something similar happening in Chicago.

> ""Of course, I watch. If the TV's on, you watch it,"" Emanuel responded. ""This
listening tour, while you do kind of watch what's happening in Baltimore, is
an outgrowth of things we've been doing step-by-step methodically over the
last four years and going forward. I'll be honest. There are good days at this
and bad days.""

OK. But the question is: What do you think of it? Do your sympathies lie in
any particular direction? Do you fear it could happen here (and if you don't,
you're an idiot)? Have you discussed Baltimore with McCarthy? Has the city
taken any precautions or reviewed its plans for protests and riots?

It would be nice to be able to have a real discussion with the mayor. He just
doesn't seem to have the humanity to make that possible, though.

( Washington, DC, October 20, 2015 ) The U.S. Senate voted 54-45 against
advancing a federal bill that would have increased penalties for immigrants
who reenter the United States after being deported and punished cities that
protect immigrants from unjustified deportation.

__

Statement from National Center for Lesbian Rights ( NCLR ) Executive Director
Kate Kendell, Esq:

""We are relieved that yet another discriminatory congressional attack against
the immigrant community in the United States has been blocked. It is
disappointing, however, that rather than advancing genuine immigration reform
that honors the dignity and value of all human lives, irrespective of their
country of origin, the Senate would prefer to punish those who are seeking
safety, shelter, and freedom from oppression and to unfairly target local
governments seeking to combat anti-immigrant discrimination and to ensure the
safety of all.""

COOK COUNTY CRIMINAL COURTHOUSE — Prosecutors say a bizarre spat between two
Manny's Deli workers started when one pushed the other while he was loading
hot gelatin into a fridge — and ended with part of an ear being bitten off.

""Let's go, Tyson,"" a Cook County sheriff's deputy said to the alleged ear
biter as he led him out of court Wednesday, referring to boxer Mike Tyson's
notorious chomping of Evander Holyfield's ears.

The 53-year-old victim now hears constant ringing and is ""permanently
disfigured,"" since doctors weren't able to reattach the earlobe, Assistant
State's Attorney Erin Antonietti said during a bond hearing Wednesday.

Sergio Sanchez, 45, and the victim work together at Manny's Deli at 1141 S.
Jefferson St., prosecutors said.

Earlier this month, Sanchez allegedly ""pushed into"" his co-worker as the man
was trying to load a container of hot Jell-O into a refrigerator, Antonietti
said.

A few days later, on April 18, Sanchez approached the victim as he walked to
work in the 1300 block of South Jefferson Street, demanding to ""finish their
argument,"" according to Antonietti.

Sanchez took off his belt and proceeded to whip the victim, prosecutors said.
He then bit the victim's ear, ripping off part of the man's earlobe, court
records show.

""The victim saw a part of his ear in [Sanchez's] mouth,"" Antonietti said in
court Wednesday.

Both men then went to work, prosecutors said, and the victim was eventually
taken to a nearby hospital. According to Antonietti, the man needed two
stitches in his temple and will need ""more medical follow-up"" for his ear
injury.

Sanchez, of the 5900 block of South Mozart Street, was charged with aggravated
battery causing great bodily harm.

Sanchez is married with children and has worked in catering for five years,
his public defender said.

Cook County Judge Donald Panarese Jr. on Wednesday said Sanchez could be
released on electronic monitoring so long as he qualifies for the Cook County
Sheriff's Office's monitoring program. If not, bail for Sanchez would be set
at $100,000.

If he's released, Sanchez would not allowed to contact the victim or go back
to work at Manny's, the judge ordered.

Atlanta

I'm a fairly reasonable person, far from confrontational, and will typically
turn the other cheek in most cases. The only scenario where I will not attempt
to keep my cool, is when someone harms or attempts to harm my child. I don't
care if you are man, woman or child, I will go there when it comes to
defending my little person.

I was devastated to hear about the teenage girl who was beaten to death in the
high school bathroom. I can't imagine being the mother who received that call.
Then, a few days ago, I saw images of the six year old who was beaten by the
fifth grader. Thankfully, she's alive and well, but reading that story got my
blood boiling again. I can't fathom what could have caused that child to do
those things to that baby. Even worse, I can't imagine how frightened the
little girl must have been through the tragic experience. As a mother, that
would piss me off beyond measure.

Right here in Chicago,  I heard about the thirteen year old girl whose mother
gave her a knife that was used to kill another teen. All of these stories have
me wondering what the hell parents are teaching their children, if anything at
all. I'm aware that not only the subject of this post may ruffle some
feathers, but I will ruffle, rip and destroy any feather that lays a hand on a
single hair on my child's head. If you aren't going to be parent enough to
make sure your child doesn't hurt or kill someone else's child, then you
should be prepared for your child being disciplined by that other parent.

I will do my best as a parent to make sure my child isn't bullying another
child, and I expect the same from other parents around me. There are far too
many instances where teachers inform parents of the children's bullying
antics, only for these concerns to be dismissed by the parent. There's nothing
cute about raising a bully, not at all. Just know that some of us fellow
parents aren't going to sit back and watch while your child gets a free pass
for bullying our child.

My baby will be starting school in the fall, and I'm not trying to be on the
other end of a tragic school phone call. I will teach her to defend herself,
but know that I'm willing to intervene if it comes to that. Of course, I'll
attempt to have a conversation with the parent and child before taking it to
the next level. I have love for all children, and won't mind teaching someone
else's child a lesson in love if necessary to protect mine, and possibly other
children too.

Now,  I'm not saying I will square up and go blow for blow with a child, but
know that there will be some discipline coming their way if the parent isn't
going to handle affairs accordingly, as it relates to someone harming my
child. I'm sure there are many parents out here who feel the same way.  My
heart goes out to the families of all children who have faced similar
tragedies.

CITY HALL — The newly formed [ Civilian Office of Police Review Authority ][4]
— which promises to do a better job of investigating allegations of excessive
force and [ misconduct by police ][5] officers — is looking for a few good men
and women.

The new agency will hold its first job fair from 5:30-7:30 p.m. Thursday at
Malcolm X College, 1104 W. Jackson Blvd.

The fair will offer potential employees information about positions with the
agency, including in investigations, public affairs, legal and administrative
departments.

The fair offers a chance for those interested to ""get in on the ground floor
and be a part of creating Chicago's new police oversight agency,"" according to
organizers.

No resumes will be collected at the fair, organizers said.

The new agency will replace the [ Independent Police Review Authority ][6] ,
which is being disbanded in the wake of the outcry prompted by the release of
a dashcam video showing a police officer fatally shoot 17-year-old [ Laquan
][7] [ McDonald ][7] 16 times two years ago.

The new agency will have 75 investigators, with 15 assigned to major cases in
which someone is killed or seriously injured by an officer, officials said.
They will report to 15 supervisors, officials said.

The Civilian Office of Police Accountability will be up and running ""as soon
as possible"" but no later than Sept. 30, according to the ordinance
establishing it. It will have a budget of $17 million once it is fully
operational.

The job fair will take place in auditorium 1104 at Malcolm X, one of the City
Colleges of Chicago.

[ Online ][8] registration for the fair is available. For more information, go

invasion and domestic battery in the west suburb.

A warrant was issued for the arrest of Kenneth J. Chavez on felony charges of
home invasion, possession of a stolen motor vehicle and unlawful restraint,
according to St. Charles police. Chavez is additionally wanted on two
misdemeanor counts of domestic battery.

Officers were called at 3:52 p.m. Saturday by staff at Mercy Medical Center in
Aurora regarding the victim of a battery, police said.

Earlier, Chavez kicked in the door of his ex-girlfriend’s home in the 500
block of North 12th Street in St. Charles and dragged her out of her home by
her neck and hair and forced her into a car, according to police, who said
Chavez was trying to convince her to get back into a relationship with him.

They went to Mercy Medical Center for treatment of her severe shoulder pain,
but left two children — ages 8 and 4 — alone in the home, police said. A
family member later went to the home to take care of them.

Police said Chavez was kicked out of the hospital by security staff for his
behavior before they were notified. He left in his ex-girlfriend’s silver,
2006 Dodge Caravan with the license plate Q648241.

Anyone with information about Chavez’s whereabouts was asked to call 911, or
speak to detectives by calling (630) 377-4435.

290038,b,http://www.bettergov.org/news/chicago-police-oversight-plan-almost-ready-for-council-ok,,Chicago Police Oversight Plan Almost Ready For Council OK,"Is the Fifth Floor of City Hall finally ready for police reform?

After numerous delays the signs are encouraging, based on recent reports
outlining significant changes in Mayor Rahm Emanuel’s oversight reform
ordinance.

Whatever City Council ends up passing will replace IPRA, the much-maligned
Independent Police Review Authority, with COPA, a more empowered Civilian
Office of Police Accountability.

The ordinance also adds a public safety deputy with his or her own staff to
the city Inspector General’s office to conduct audits and reviews of every
agency involved in public safety.

After the mayor’s office released an incomplete draft in August the [ Better
Government Association ][1] joined other critics in [ urging the City Council
][2] to give these new offices budget security and the power to hire outside
attorneys.

These watchdogs shouldn’t have to appear before the City Council each year to
plead for enough money to do their jobs.  Their important responsibilities
require guaranteed resources.

In addition, lawyers representing police officers accused of misconduct
shouldn’t have a role on oversight bodies responsible for investigating the
same cops.

[ Embed from Getty Images ][3]

These reforms—independent budgets and independent counsel—are common sense
provisions designed to insulate these critical oversight agencies from the
political whims of elected officials.

The mayor’s apparently been listening.

In his latest draft both agencies have an established budget floor, and with
some restrictions, COPA can hire outside attorneys for advice, representation
and enforcement of subpoenas.

It’s worth noting the city’s IG, Joe Ferguson, doesn’t have independent
subpoena enforcement power, but that’s a reform fight for another day.

As for the COPA ordinance, there are other bright spots, including authority
to recommend revisions in police collective bargaining agreements, which have
historically included problematic provisions that undermine investigations of
alleged misconduct.

The ordinance also authorizes COPA to review an officer’s complaint history in
any new investigation, which makes it imperative to keep good records.

But here’s the problem:  The current police contract calls for destruction of
misconduct allegations older than four years.

[ Embed from Getty Images ][4]

You can’t review a complaint history that [ isn’t there ][5] .

So the BGA and others have been fighting for the [ preservation ][6] of
decades of misconduct records on two fronts: [ legislative ][7] and [ legal
][8] .  Those fights continue.

To that end we’re urging City Council to review the next police contract with
a fine-toothed comb and reject any deal that contains a records destruction
provision.

We also hope the aldermen don’t approve the latest COPA draft, which is likely
to come up for a vote on Wednesday, without considering a few remaining
questions:

  * Should former non-sworn police department staffers or ex-employees of the Co
ok County State’s Attorney’s office be permanently barred from applying for the 
top COPA job, or just constrained by the five-year cooling off period currently 
included in the ordinance? 
  * Should there be an enforcement mechanism to ensure the public safety deputy’
s recommendations aren’t routinely ignored? 
  * What additional role is the community going to play in the accountability pr
ocess?  Another oversight panel proposed by the Mayor’s Police Accountability Ta
sk Force, the Community Safety Oversight Board, hasn’t been designed yet. 

Getting that panel right is an important piece of the overall puzzle.

So let’s hope that before the final vote is taken the mayor’s office and the
City Council answer the questions we’ve raised, and ask the ones we’ve missed,
with open minds and a commitment to pass a police accountability ordinance
that’s tough but fair.

The stakes are too high for anything less than everyone’s best.

</html>",Navajo Nation officer dies after responding to domestic violence call - Chicago Tribune,"A tribal police officer shot dead over the weekend in a remote community on
the nation's largest American Indian reservation died after he encountered two
people in a vehicle along a county road while responding to a domestic
violence report, authorities said Monday.

Preliminary reports indicate Navajo Nation Officer Houston James Largo, 27,
was critically wounded when he came into contact with the two after being sent
to a rural address north of the town of Prewitt, said McKinley County
Sheriff's Deputy Roberta Jaramillo.

""A female saw that the officer was down and called dispatch over his radio,""
Jaramillo said.

Navajo police were already on the scene when sheriff's deputies and New Mexico
state police officers arrived. Authorities quickly identified a suspect and
the search intensified as daylight broke. Footprints helped officers to track
the suspect, who was taken into custody early Sunday.

Authorities did not immediately release any information about the suspect, the
circumstances of the arrest or what led to the shooting.

A decorated officer, Largo was flown to University of New Mexico Hospital in
Albuquerque and died hours later Sunday, his death spurring a flood on
condolences on social media from other police agencies around the country and
family members of other law enforcement officers.

Largo was the first officer killed this year in New Mexico and one of several
shot in the U.S. while on duty. This follows a year in which the number of law
enforcement officers shot and killed increased sharply, according to the
National Law Enforcement Officers Memorial Fund.

James Tierney, the acting U.S. attorney for New Mexico, said in a statement
that Largo was dedicated to his job and had touched many through his work on
the Navajo Nation and his commission as a special federal officer with the
Bureau of Indian Affairs' Office of Justice Services.

""His loss is a tragic reminder that the work of our law enforcement officers
is profoundly heroic and deserving of our most emphatic support,"" Tierney
said.

Navajo Nation President Russell Begaye said tribal officers are well-trained
but constantly face danger on the job.

""They are the ones who stand guard over our nation and protect us,"" Begaye
said in a statement.

There are roughly 225 sworn officers in the Navajo Police Department, which
covers more than 27,000 square miles in portions of New Mexico, Arizona and
Utah.

With Largo's death, the tribe has lost 13 officers in the line of duty since
1975.

   Chance and Chief Keef ""are two opposite ends of the spectrum. They're definitely the yin and yang and they always have been,"" said Andrew Barber, whose Fake Shore Drive hip-hop blog was one of the first media outlets casting attention on both rappers. They ""come from totally different backgrounds. Telling two totally different stories. They're seeing things a different way. That's why they're both so important.""

   Chance, who won three Grammy awards this year and is headlining Lollapalooza, has become the city's odds-on favorite. A product of a stable, two-parent household who graduated from the prestigious Jones College Prep, the rapper born Chancelor Bennett, 24, has parlayed his gospel- and poetry-inspired mixtapes into a successful music career. His aspirational raps have earned him a host of friends and admirers, from President Obama and Beyonce to rocker Eddie Vedder.
  </p>
  <p>
   He has won over parents and teachers with the millions he donated and helped raise for Chicago Public Schools. And his stock as an activist has risen, following disagreements with Gov. Bruce Rauner and Mayor Rahm Emanuel and his recent call for HBO to end comedian Bill Maher's series after the host uttered a racial slur. Ebony magazine recently put the rapper on its front cover asking ""Chance For President?""

   Then there's Chief Keef, 21, the dread-headed stepchild of Chicago rap, remembered as much for problems with the law and his halted concerts as his music. Before Chance became prince of the city it was Chief Keef who helped introduce rap lovers to the city's pervasive gang culture and violence.
  </p>

   Born Keith Cozart, the Black Disciples-linked youth who was mostly raised by his grandmother, was busted for selling heroin at 15 and pointing a gun at a Chicago police officer at 16, according to court records.

   Chief Keef burst onto the national rap scene in 2012, when fellow South Side native Kanye West's musical reworking of his local hit ""I Don't Like"" became an international platinum-selling smash.
  </p>
  <p>
   Soon record executives were eager to take advantage of the teenager's rough sound. ""When people first heard (Chief Keef's) name, I was getting phone calls immediately,"" Barber recalled. ""Then we started posting (stories) about him and for the next six months I think everybody in the music business came to Chicago trying to find Keef.""
  </p>
  <p>
   I learned just how influential Chief Keef is recently over burgers and fries with my nephews, 16 and 19. Discussing Chance, they said glowing things about his music, adding that they supported him because of his positive message and local connection.
  </p>
  <p>
   Then I mentioned Chief Keef's name and it was like a light came on. The 16-year-old looked up from his iPhone and made eye contact. ""He's a legend,"" he said. ""A pioneer,"" the 19-year-old added.

   Chief Keef's use of social media to generate buzz for his music has made him a role model for young artists. Young listeners are also attracted to his gang ties — a sign of authenticity in the perception-conscious rap world. They aren't put off by the fact that Chief Keef has been criticized by law enforcement, elected officials and even some veteran hip-hop artists who accuse him of dumbing down rap.

   Even in neighborhoods where teens are recruited as gang assassins, Chief Keef gave hope to gangsters that their rhymes could be a means for escape as it had been for Chief Keef himself.
  </p>
  <p>
   His violent and crude tales portraying hard-knock young men in search of money and good times has fascinated city and suburban kids alike. ""I'm Southside, I'll pop out/ OBlock bring them Glocks out/ 300 bring them chops out/ We shoot up your block now,"" Chief Keef rapped in ""Citgo.""

   ""People just saw it as a raw different sound. They bought into the back story of Chief Keef, which I think a lot of people found just as intriguing as the music,"" Barber said.
  </p>
  <p>
   The Chicago of Chance's and Chief Keef's disparate rap tales is the ongoing story of communities at the tail end of a silent and slow four-decade erosion of resources.
  </p>
  <p>
   Chance represents the multitude of socially conscious and social-climbing youth who, through talent or ambition, have a legitimate shot of success despite living in crumbling communities. Chief Keef symbolizes the untold numbers of dispirited young men who are surrounded by tragedy, poverty and criminality with few prospects for escaping.
  </p>
  <p>
   An exodus of residents, the Great Recession and the ravages of drug and gang wars have left deserted blocks and broken families in an already-debt ridden city and state. With few jobs or opportunities in their neighborhoods, nearly half of the city's black men between 20 and 24 (Chance and Chief Keef's age group) don't have jobs and aren't in college, according to a report from the University of Illinois at Chicago's Great Cities Institute.
  </p>
  <p>
   It is to this Chicago that Chance and Chief Keef came of age, the sons of a dying black community that 180,000 Africans-Americans have left since the early 2000s.
  </p>
  <p>
   Chance's music and philanthropy has captured the city's attention, but Chicago's problems with violence in the most-distressed neighborhoods is being perpetrated by a number of men and boys who see Chief Keef's version of city life as their own.
  </p>
  <p>
   If Chicago is to solve the cipher of gangs, street violence and abandonment, it first needs to figure out how to turn its disadvantaged, desperate young men into productive citizens.
  </p>
  <p>
   Learning to understand Chief Keef's Chicago and key sources of desperation within it could give social service agencies, city officials and community leaders clues as how to best neutralize the hopelessness that leads to crime. It also wouldn't hurt them to study Chance's Chicago and its dwindling resources if they hope to retain capable homegrown talent before it flees Illinois.
  </p>
  <p>
   And while we're busy patting ourselves on the back for producing a talent like Chance, we should remember that the neighborhoods helped create Chief Keef too, for better or for worse.

",Chance and Chief Keef: A tale of two rappers,"With Chicago's national reputation ranging from tourist heaven to gang war zone,
it seems appropriate that two of its brightest stars are rap golden boy [ Chance
the Rapper ][46] and rap bad boy [ Chief Keef ][47] .

Beyond their divergent musical styles, the artists exemplify the dueling
personalities within black communities on the South and West sides fighting for
the souls of men and boys.

Chance and Chief Keef ""are two opposite ends of the spectrum. They're definitely
the yin and yang and they always have been,"" said Andrew Barber, whose Fake
Shore Drive hip-hop blog was one of the first media outlets casting attention on
both rappers. They ""come from totally different backgrounds. Telling two totally
different stories. They're seeing things a different way. That's why they're
both so important.""

Since they emerged as teenage rap prodigies in the early 2010s, each has carved
out his own identity and fan base.

Chance, who won three Grammy awards this year and is headlining Lollapalooza,
has become the city's odds-on favorite. A product of a stable, two-parent
household who graduated from the prestigious Jones College Prep, the rapper born
Chancelor Bennett, 24, has parlayed his gospel- and poetry-inspired mixtapes
into a successful music career. His aspirational raps have earned him a host of
friends and admirers, from President Obama and Beyonce to rocker Eddie Vedder.

He has won over parents and teachers with the millions he donated and helped
raise for Chicago Public Schools. And his stock as an activist has risen,
following disagreements with Gov. Bruce Rauner and Mayor Rahm Emanuel and his
recent call for HBO to end comedian Bill Maher's series after the host uttered a
racial slur. Ebony magazine recently put the rapper on its front cover asking
""Chance For President?""

Chance the Rapper has come a long way and his trajectory is one watched and
marveled by many.

marveled by many.

Then there's Chief Keef, 21, the dread-headed stepchild of Chicago rap,
remembered as much for problems with the law and his halted concerts as his
music. Before Chance became prince of the city it was Chief Keef who helped
introduce rap lovers to the city's pervasive gang culture and violence.

Born Keith Cozart, the Black Disciples-linked youth who was mostly raised by his
grandmother, was busted for selling heroin at 15 and pointing a gun at a Chicago
police officer at 16, according to court records.

Chief Keef burst onto the national rap scene in 2012, when fellow South Side
native Kanye West's musical reworking of his local hit ""I Don't Like"" became an
international platinum-selling smash.

Soon record executives were eager to take advantage of the teenager's rough
sound. ""When people first heard (Chief Keef's) name, I was getting phone calls
immediately,"" Barber recalled. ""Then we started posting (stories) about him and
for the next six months I think everybody in the music business came to Chicago
trying to find Keef.""

I learned just how influential Chief Keef is recently over burgers and fries
with my nephews, 16 and 19. Discussing Chance, they said glowing things about
his music, adding that they supported him because of his positive message and
local connection.

Then I mentioned Chief Keef's name and it was like a light came on. The 16-year-
old looked up from his iPhone and made eye contact. ""He's a legend,"" he said. ""A
pioneer,"" the 19-year-old added.

Chief Keef's use of social media to generate buzz for his music has made him a
role model for young artists. Young listeners are also attracted to his gang
ties — a sign of authenticity in the perception-conscious rap world. They aren't
put off by the fact that Chief Keef has been criticized by law enforcement,
elected officials and even some veteran hip-hop artists who accuse him of
dumbing down rap.

Even in neighborhoods where teens are recruited as gang assassins, Chief Keef
gave hope to gangsters that their rhymes could be a means for escape as it had
been for Chief Keef himself.

His violent and crude tales portraying hard-knock young men in search of money
and good times has fascinated city and suburban kids alike. ""I'm Southside, I'll
pop out/ OBlock bring them Glocks out/ 300 bring them chops out/ We shoot up
your block now,"" Chief Keef rapped in ""Citgo.""

""People just saw it as a raw different sound. They bought into the back story of
Chief Keef, which I think a lot of people found just as intriguing as the
music,"" Barber said.

The Chicago of Chance's and Chief Keef's disparate rap tales is the ongoing
story of communities at the tail end of a silent and slow four-decade erosion of
resources.

Chance represents the multitude of socially conscious and social-climbing youth
who, through talent or ambition, have a legitimate shot of success despite
living in crumbling communities. Chief Keef symbolizes the untold numbers of
dispirited young men who are surrounded by tragedy, poverty and criminality with
few prospects for escaping.

An exodus of residents, the Great Recession and the ravages of drug and gang
wars have left deserted blocks and broken families in an already-debt ridden
city and state. With few jobs or opportunities in their neighborhoods, nearly
half of the city's black men between 20 and 24 (Chance and Chief Keef's age
group) don't have jobs and aren't in college, according to a report from the
University of Illinois at Chicago's Great Cities Institute.

It is to this Chicago that Chance and Chief Keef came of age, the sons of a
dying black community that 180,000 Africans-Americans have left since the early
2000s.

Chance's music and philanthropy has captured the city's attention, but Chicago's
problems with violence in the most-distressed neighborhoods is being perpetrated
by a number of men and boys who see Chief Keef's version of city life as their
own.

If Chicago is to solve the cipher of gangs, street violence and abandonment, it
first needs to figure out how to turn its disadvantaged, desperate young men
into productive citizens.

Learning to understand Chief Keef's Chicago and key sources of desperation
within it could give social service agencies, city officials and community
leaders clues as how to best neutralize the hopelessness that leads to crime. It
also wouldn't hurt them to study Chance's Chicago and its dwindling resources if
they hope to retain capable homegrown talent before it flees Illinois.

And while we're busy patting ourselves on the back for producing a talent like
Chance, we should remember that the neighborhoods helped create Chief Keef too,
for better or for worse.

",County officials call for state Supreme Court to act on bond system | Chicago Sun-Times,"Add the first African-American to lead the U.S. Department of Justice to the
list of powerful people who think the Cook County cash bond system is unfair.

Public Defender Amy Campanelli on Tuesday formally unveiled a report by former
U.S. Attorney General Eric Holder that surveyed state and federal court rulings
and decades of reports on the Cook County criminal courts.

The report, dated last month, showed a consistent trend in the data: the county
jail is more than half-full of defendants who simply can’t afford to post bail,
a situation that seems to defy constitutional protections against.

Joined at a press conference at the Chicago Temple by County Commissioner Jesus

the state Supreme Court to require that judges statewide start setting bond
amounts that defendants can afford to pay. A mandate from the Supreme Court

“Judges must follow the law,” Campanelli said. “If you are going to set a bond

 </p>
 <p>
  <span>
   <b>
    What’s the difference between COPA and IPRA?
   </b>
  </span>
 </p>
 <p>
  <span>
   Let’s start with what’s the same. COPA will have largely the same mission as IPRA: investigate allegations of police misconduct and recommend discipline. Chief administrator Sharon Fairley will stay on to head COPA, which will have the same offices on the Near West Side.
  </span>
 </p>
 <div id=""inpage_newsletter_signup_wrapper"">
 </div>
 <p>
  <span>
   But when training kicked off in May, Fairley insisted COPA will be different from IPRA.
  </span>
 </p>
 <p>
  <span>
   “We have been in the process of building a new agency from the ground up,” Fairley said. “So everything about the way we operate is going to be different.”
  </span>
 </p>
 <p>
  <span>
   The key difference, officials said, is how COPA is funded compared to its predecessor.
  </span>
  <a href=""http://copanew.wpengine.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/10/Ordinance-COPA.pdf"" target=""_blank"">
   <span>
    The ordinance that created the new agency
   </span>
  </a>
  <span>
   guaranteed it gets at least one percent of the annual appropriation for the Chicago Police Department. IPRA had no such guaranteed funding.
  </span>
 </p>
 <p>
  <span>
   Unlike IPRA, COPA officials will also be permitted to seek outside legal counsel rather than being forced to rely on the city’s Law Department, which is controlled by the mayor.
  </span>
 </p>
 <p>
  <span>
   The new agency will also be bigger, with a budgeted 100 investigators, compared to about 75 for IPRA. And officials said those investigators will be better trained.
  </span>
 </p>
 <p>
  <span>
   <b>
    How is the training different?
   </b>
  </span>
 </p>
 <p>
  <span>
   Every COPA investigator and member had to go through something the agency dubbed “COPA Academy,” a six-week training program on investigative processes, practices, and principles.
  </span>
 </p>
 <p>
  <span>
   Fairley said it was a “much more comprehensive approach to training.”
  </span>
 </p>
 <p>
  <span>
   “IPRA training was, I wouldn’t say, haphazard. But it wasn’t as systematically done,” Fairley said.
  </span>
 </p>
 <p>
  <span>
   She said there will also be a focus on continued training that wasn’t available under her predecessors.
  </span>
 </p>
 <p>
  <span>
   There are also tougher requirements for those employees who will be investigating police shootings. COPA includes a new position, called a major case specialist. Fairley said employees with that job will have to get state training to qualify as “lead homicide investigators.”
  </span>
 </p>
 <p>
  <span>
   <b>
    Why did city officials decide to dump IPRA?
   </b>
  </span>
 </p>
 <p>
  <span>
   When IPRA was created in 2007 it was heralded as an answer to complaints about the old police accountability system, the police department’s Office of Professional Standards.
  </span>
 </p>
 <p>
  <span>
   But in the years between its inception and the release of the Laquan McDonald video in November of 2015, IPRA investigated about 400 shootings by police — and found the officers justified in every incident except two.

",What’s New In How Chicago Investigates Police Shootings? Officials Say Training And Funding,"Friday marks the official start of Chicago’s  [ Civilian Office of Police
Accountability  ][1] , which will be tasked with investigating police shootings
and serious allegations of misconduct like excessive force.

The new agency, known by the acronym COPA (pronounced like Copacabana), is the
latest effort to change Chicago’s system of disciplining officers, a key concern
of activists,  [ experts  ][2] and the  [ U.S. Department of Justice  ][3] .

The agency will replace the Independent Police Review Authority (IPRA), which
was scrapped amidst the public outcry after the release of a video that showed a
Chicago police officer fatally shooting 17-year-old  [ Laquan McDonald  ][4] .

Here’s a look at how COPA formed and what the change will really mean.

   ’s recommended full-year budget for the new police oversight agency falls below the funding floor that was a point of controversy when the office was created last year.
  </p>
  <p>
   The 2016 ordinance holds that the Civilian Office of Police Accountability budget will be no less than 1 percent of the Police Department’s budget, excluding grant funds. COPA’s recommended 2018 budget is just under $13.3 million, about $1.9 million short of equaling 1 percent of the Police Department’s recommended allotment of about $1.52 billion in nongrant money.

   Asked by reporters after the hearing whether COPA is being shortchanged, Banks said she didn’t know.

   “With reference to the budget issue, again, I’m going to plead new,” she said. “I’m concerned that we as an agency get our fair share of the budget allotment.”

   The new agency was forged in the controversy sparked nearly two years ago by the court-ordered release of video of a white police officer shooting black teen Laquan McDonald 16 times.

   City officials have touted the new agency’s expanded staff and revamped practices, but COPA got off to a turbulent start in September when news emerged that Chief Administrator Sharon Fairley, who led the construction of the new office, would leave to run for Illinois attorney general. Her departure, made public just 10 days after the agency opened, added to multiple vacancies in the fledgling organization’s top ranks.

   Fairley attended Wednesday’s hearing in the gallery of the City Council chambers.

   The question of COPA’s leadership has been politically contentious, as reform advocates have said the head of the agency must be insulated from politics. Some 18 months ago, Emanuel's Police Accountability Task Force recommended that the city impanel a community oversight board to monitor law enforcement and pick COPA's leader. Emanuel said he would create the board but yielded to community groups' requests to help design it, his aides have said. Community groups have been working on recommendations, but those have yet to emerge.

  </p>
  <p>
   During Wednesday’s hearing, Banks noted that she’d only been with the agency a few weeks and referred numerous questions to her staff.

",Aldermen question funding for new Chicago police oversight agency,"Chicago aldermen complained Wednesday that Mayor [ Rahm Emanuel ][21] ’s
recommended full-year budget for the new police oversight agency falls below the
funding floor that was a point of controversy when the office was created last
year.

The 2016 ordinance holds that the Civilian Office of Police Accountability
budget will be no less than 1 percent of the Police Department’s budget,
excluding grant funds. COPA’s recommended 2018 budget is just under $13.3
million, about $1.9 million short of equaling 1 percent of the Police
Department’s recommended allotment of about $1.52 billion in nongrant money.

The funding floor was added to the ordinance as Emanuel worked last year to
build support for creating the agency. The former police oversight agency, the [
Independent Police Review Authority ][22] , was widely seen as insufficiently
resourced for the task of overseeing a 12,000-strong police force plagued by
allegations of excessive force and misconduct, and reform advocates voiced
concern at the time that a new agency could represent a change in name only.

At COPA’s budget hearing Wednesday, Ald. [ Scott Waguespack ][23] , 32nd, said
the City Council had worked “very diligently” on making sure the new agency was
fully funded and independent.

“This was not what we agreed to, and … this has to change before we come back
and vote on this budget,” he said.

Ald. [ Raymond Lopez ][24] , 15th, told COPA’s interim head, Patricia Banks,
that a small amount of money could be significant to an agency with a budget
that is tiny compared with the Police Department it oversees.

“Don’t be afraid to ask what you are owed as a department,” he told Banks.

Banks deferred to the Office of Budget and Management for a specific explanation
of the numbers, but told aldermen, “At this point in time, I’m not prepared to
say that we’re not adequately funded right now.”

Asked by reporters after the hearing whether COPA is being shortchanged, Banks
said she didn’t know.

“With reference to the budget issue, again, I’m going to plead new,” she said.
“I’m concerned that we as an agency get our fair share of the budget allotment.”

A spokeswoman for the budget office did not offer an immediate response to the
aldermen’s concerns.

The new agency was forged in the controversy sparked nearly two years ago by the
court-ordered release of video of a white police officer shooting black teen
Laquan McDonald 16 times. That scandal drew attention to the many shortcomings
of IPRA, which was sluggish and prone to clearing officers, even when compelling
evidence suggested wrongdoing.

City officials have touted the new agency’s expanded staff and revamped
practices, but COPA got off to a turbulent start in September when news emerged
that Chief Administrator Sharon Fairley, who led the construction of the new
office, would leave to run for Illinois attorney general. Her departure, made
public just 10 days after the agency opened, added to multiple vacancies in the
fledgling organization’s top ranks.

Fairley attended Wednesday’s hearing in the gallery of the City Council
chambers.

The question of COPA’s leadership has been politically contentious, as reform
advocates have said the head of the agency must be insulated from politics. Some
18 months ago, Emanuel's Police Accountability Task Force recommended that the
city impanel a community oversight board to monitor law enforcement and pick
COPA's leader. Emanuel said he would create the board but yielded to community
groups' requests to help design it, his aides have said. Community groups have
been working on recommendations, but those have yet to emerge.

In early October, Emanuel announced that he’d named a City Council ally, Ald. [
Ariel Reboyras ][25] , 30th, to co-chair a panel charged with finding a
permanent leader, bucking his task force’s recommendation. At the same time,
Emanuel named Banks, a retired Cook County judge who once ran the jurisdiction’s
elder law division, as interim leader.

During Wednesday’s hearing, Banks noted that she’d only been with the agency a
few weeks and referred numerous questions to her staff.
