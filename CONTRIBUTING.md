# Setup

Fork this repo, download it, and navigate to it. If you're going to be developing it doesn't necessarily make sense to install as a package, but you'll still need to install the dependencies. See the [README](README.md) for more info.

Once that's done, a good place to start is the [notebooks](./lib/notebooks). Reading through these should help you get up to speed, and running them is a pretty good test to make sure everything is installed correctly. You will need the data to run the notebooks. There is no current cloud-based data sharing solution being used. Instead, it is contained on a USB drive, come to the Chi Hack Night meeting to get it! If this will be a problem for you but you are still interested, contact one of the maintainers.

# What can I do?

You can check out the [open issues](https://github.com/chicago-justice-project/article-tagging/issues) and see if there's anything you'd like to tackle there.

If not, you can try and improve upon the existing model(s), but be warned, measuring performance in a multi-label task is non-trivial. See the `bag-of-words-count-stemmed-binary.ipynb` notebook for an attempt at doing so. Tweaking that notebook and seeing how performance changes might be a good place to start tinkering with the NLP code. You can also read the `tagnews.crimetype.benchmark.py` file to get an idea of how the cross validation is being performed.

Further yet, you can help improve this very documentation.

# FAQ

### Where is this scraped data that you're using and how do I get it?
The scraped data is NOT housed in a Github repositiory - it's on a flash drive.  Come to Chi Hack Night in person and save it onto your computer!

### Do I have to use a specific language to participate in article-tagging?

Thusfar, most of the work has been done in Python and R, but there's no reason that always has to be the case. If there is another language that would be perfect for this project or that you have expertise in, that works too. Talk with us and we can figure something out.

### Are there concepts that will be helpful for me to understand?

Definitely!  [This sklearn user guide](http://scikit-learn.org/stable/modules/feature_extraction.html#text-feature-extraction) details a number of the text analysis methodologies this project uses (sklearn is a Python library, but the user guide is great for understanding machine learning text analysis in general).  Also, see the section on 'Automated Article Tagging' in the [README](./README.md) for more detailed literature on some of the relevant concepts. Reading the code and looking up concepts you are unfamiliar with is a valid path forward as well!

### I want to contribute to Chicago Justice Project but I donâ€™t want to work on this NLP stuff. What can I do?

You can help out the [the team scraping articles/maintaining the volunteers' web interface](https://github.com/chicago-justice-project/chicago-justice). If that doesn't sound interesting either, we can always use more [volunteer taggers](http://chicagojustice.org/volunteer-for-cjp/). Or just show up Tuesday nights and ask what you can do!

### How do I productize a model?

You [pickle](https://docs.python.org/3.6/library/pickle.html) it. But working with pickle is difficult. In order to sanely be able load things, I'm running python files that pickle the model using the `-m` flag, e.g. `python -m tagnews.crimetype.models.binary_stemmed_logistic.model` will run code that generates the pickles of the model. All modules should be imported in the same way they will exist when unpickling the model from `tagnews.crimetype.tag`.
